Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'

Sürtükleri becerip hap alıyorum
Adamım, kendimi rock yıldızı gibi hissediyorum
Kardeşlerimin otu sağlam
Ve Rasta gibi tüttürüyorlar
Benimle uğraş, Uzi'ni kap gel
Ortaya çık ve vurucularımla karşılaş
Dostlarım mahallene uğradığında o silahın gra-ta-ta-ta gibi patlayacağından emin olacaklar

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Tarzımı değiştirdim, siyahlar içerisinde geldim
""Huzur içinde yat Bon Scott"" demeye başladım
Kapıyı kapat, tüttürüyoruz
Benden çakmak istedi beni Morrisson sanıyor (ayy)
Sahnede aptal gibi davran
Büyük ihtimalle şovumdan polis arabası ile ayrılacaksın
Efsaneviydi, Montage'ın tepesinden televizyonu aşağı fırlattı
Masanın üstünde Kokain var, likör karışıyor hiç bir şey umrumuzda değil
Dostum, kız arkadaşın bir sürtük içeri girmeye uğraşıyor
""Ben gruptanım"" diyor (ayy, ayy)
Kafayı yemiş gibi davranmaya başladı pantolonlarımdan tutmaya çalışıyor
Karavanımda yüz tane orospu var ve hiç birinin bir erkeği yok
Hepsi bir arkadaşını getirmiş

Sürtükleri becerip hap alıyorum

Hills'de süperstarları beceriyordum

Henny yudumluyorum fena orospular havuzuma atlıyor
Ve sütyenleri yok
Arkadan vur, saçlarından çek
""Yeter artık"" diye bağırıyor (evet, evet, evet)
""Savage, neden 12 tane garajın var ve 6 araban var?"" diye soruyorlar
İlişki aramıyorum, bunu nasıl buldun? (nasıl buldun?)
Karıcığın benim tam yalamalık olduğumu düşünüyor (yalamalık)
Yeşil yüzlükler kasamda, eski paralarım var (eski para)
LA sürtükleri her zaman ""Kokain nerde"" diye sorar (21,21)
Rock yıldızı gibi yaşa, polis arabasını parçala
Pop-Tart'dan daha tatlı, sert olmadığını biliyorsun
En yükseklere çıktım, hatırla sağlam traplerdim

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

He seemed like he was pretty cool

Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (Outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (Hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (Hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
700, three high fives, look alive, look alive ('Live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (Word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (Huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (Outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (Hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I— (Hah)

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
Bitch, come through (Through)
You and you (You)
I'ma get the money (Word)
Dr—Dr—Drizzy get the loot (The loot)
Pu—pu—pull up with that Draco (Huh?)
Play with Drake and I'ma shoot (That's on my mama)
My—my—my weapon be a instrument
I'll blow you like a flute (Rrah)
Ni—ni—nigga play so he feelin' it (Feelin' it)
Pu—pull up broad day with a K, now he shiverin' (He shiverin')
Drop a nigga like he litterin' (Huh?)
W—w—we at your door like we the delivery (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
He not a plug, he middle man (Middle man)
That—that nigga brown like cinnamon (Cinnamon)
I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson (Uh)
Shot to the chest have you gaspin' for oxygen (Shots)
I'ma spray 'em, just like Febreze (Huh, like Febreze)
Came a long way from sittin' in the nosebleeds (In the nosebleeds)
Now a nigga on the floor talkin' to the athletes (To the athletes)
Now I'm so close to the game that I could steal the stat sheet (Stat sheet)
It's Bloc

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('Live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (Word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (Huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (Outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died

9,Yes Indeed,Lil Baby & Drake,"[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here",2018
