Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol’ up, lil’, hol' up, lil’ bitch)

[Verse 2]
Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Quavo! Ben aynı yerde ünlenen ilk adamım(ünlenen)
O kendisine üstü açık arabalar getirecek (üstü açık araba)
Geri dönüyoruz, seksek falan oynadığımız günleri hatırla? (seksek)
Mahalleyi polisler kontrol ederken geri çekilmemi söyleyen sendin (polisler)
Sen uyandığında hayallerini gerçekleştireceğim (hayallerin)
Makyajsız bile aynı gözükeceksin
Annene uğradım, neyden yapıldığını görmeliyim (anan)
Onların paralarını umursamak zorunda değilsin benimkiler üstümde
Benim hayatıma girebilirsin o ün otobüsüne binmen gerek (skrt)
Çünkü söz veriyorum dışarı çıktığımızda ünlü olacaksın
Modern zamanın Bonnie ve Clyde'ı bizi öyle isimlendirdiler (Clyde)

Uh, sanırım bütün yüzünü yeni Chanellarla kaplamış
Fiyatı beğendi, taşları gördü, kukusu titredi
Onunla klüpte tanıştığımda nasıl hissettiğini sordum
Ayağa kalkıp koca götünü Gucci pantolonuma koydu
Labelımız yok
Şişeler istediğini söyledi, masamız yok
Yatağının çerçevesi yok, masaları yok
Netflix izliyorduk, kablo tvsi yokmuş, pekala
Fiş, fiş, fiş, ben onu şarj ederim
Saçlarından tutup kapıyı onun için tutan bir zenciyi arzuluyor
Bebeğim, o sadece benim, sürtük benim için sorun yok
Bebeğim, tamam, pekala

Onu mu arıyorsun?
Pekala, kaltak ona bakıyorsun
Şimdiye kadar ki en iyisiyim, ama en iyim henüz gelmek üzere
Çünkü ben birilerini arıyordum
Sıradan bir sikiği değil
Birilerini öldürmeme sebep olma
Bu herhangi biri ve herkes için
Oh, Tanrım! Bana her gün yazıyor, cevap alamıyor
Kaltak, tepemi attırıyorsun
Bu altını bronza çevirmek gibi bir şey, gözlerimi deviriyorum
Ve o Molly kullandığı zaman zombiye dönüşüyor
O bizim Clyde ve Bonnie olduğumuzu düşünüyor
Tanrım, beni affet! Tunechi F akıyorum, ben bir efsaneyim
Dosdoğru Crescent'tan
Bebeğini Essence'a uçuruyorum
Kayıtlara geçsin, Khaled'i rekorlar kırdığında tanıyordum
Mula Gang, rekoru kazanıyoruz
Eski sevgilililerimin üstünde akıyorum, oh Tanrım!

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over!""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

She said, ""I am not afraid to die"" (Yeah)
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (Yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge",2017

8,Black Beatles,Rae Sremmurd Featuring Gucci Mane,"[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (remember)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)

9,iSpy,KYLE Featuring Lil Yachty,"[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım


[Verse 1: Kyle]
Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil
Yüksek notada bitireceğiz

[Chorus: Kyle]
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
Bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
Bir Hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
Genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
Modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
O kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
Kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
Herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
Woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
Sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""Beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
Beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
Üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
Dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
Arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (Raggy!)
Beni siklememeye devam et
Uzun zamandır lüks içinde yaşıyorum, hayır
Boat ve Kyle piyano tuşları gibi birbirinden ayrılmaz
Anneannemin üstüne yemin ederim ki asla bir orospuyu kondomsuz sikmem

[Chorus: Kyle]
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver


[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...",2017
