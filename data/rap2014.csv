I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone public, excuse me
Been wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
But With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

[Verse 2: Eminem]
No I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it
You-you won there's no more u-u-using your mind
The way it worked)
Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's so great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free

Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Million five on the Visa card (Woo)
Hundred bands stacked look like some fuckin' Titans (Football player)
Nigga servin' great white like I'm feedin' sharks (Sheesh)
I won't do nothin' with the bitch, she can't even get me hard (Woo)
Somethin' wrong with the pussy (What?)
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'ma still make sure that she douche it ('Cause what?)
Me and my woadie, we don't get caught up like that, no way (No way)
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J, hey (Woo)

Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches, I'm yawnin' (And why?)
Hey, think this a show, bitch, I'm performin'

Ain't gonna be latchin' on my niggas, ayy (No way, no way)
Niggas couldn't see me if they had a genie (Woo)

I ain't got AIDS but I swear to God I would bleed (Suwoop)

28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E (Ooh)
Pee on top of these bitches (Ooh)
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
I'm in that Corvette with baby mommy gettin' sloppy toppy (Skrrt, skrrt, woo)

I do it for my daddy (Ayy), I do it for my mama (I do)
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up (Come up)
I'm Willie B beatin' on my chest, in the jungle, ayy (Hey)
Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grindin' with no sleep (Swear)
Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way (Nah)
Thugga Thugger, that's my brother, brother (Thugger, Thugger)
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle, knuckle (Hey)
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot ya (Fuh fuh)
Punchin' on the gas (Skrrt), too fast, and I lose ya (Hey)

[Outro: Birdman]
Sitting in the middle of this ocean, Pacific that is
You understand me? Bunch of bad bitches, ya heard?
Popping that GTV, living that lifestyle, ya heard?
I do this for Ms. Gladys, boy - 100
