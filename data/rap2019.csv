Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin’ and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can’t nobody tell me nothin’
You can’t tell me nothin’

Hat down, cross town, livin’ like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby’s got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I’ve been through all that
I’m like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride ’til I can’t no more

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)

She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off a pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid (Uh huh)
Was expectin' the box to pull up on a truck
Man, this nigga pulled up on a scooter (The fuck?)

[Chorus]
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want, I'm good (Good)
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want
I'm good (Good)
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah",2019
9,Goodbyes,Post Malone Featuring Young Thug,"[Letra de ""Post Malone - Goodbyes ft. Young Thug (Traducción al Español)""]

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Kurt y yo sentimos lo mismo, demasiado placer es dolor
Mi chica me escupe en vano, todo lo que hago es quejarme
Necesita que algo cambie, necesito salir del margen
Así que a la mierda todo esta noche
Y no me digas que me calle
Cuando sabes que hablas demasiado
Pero no tienes una mierda que decir (Decir)

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Verso 2: Post Malone]
Los dos estamos actuando como locos, pero somos demasiado tercos para cambiar
Ahora estoy bebiendo otra vez, con 80 grados de alcohol en mis venas
Y mis dedos se tiñeron, mirando por encima del borde
No me jodas esta noche
Dijiste que necesitabas este corazón, ahora lo tienes (Lo tienes)
Resulta que no era lo que querías (Querías)
Y como no lo soltabamos, lo perdimos
Ahora soy un desahuciado

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado (Salvado, también)
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Verso 3: Young Thug]
Te quiero fuera de mi vida
Te quiero de vuelta aquí esta noche
Estoy tratando de cortarte, sin cuchillo
Quiero rebanarte y cortarte en cubitos
Mi argumento es posesivo, te hizo preciso
¿No puedes apagar el televisor? Estoy viendo la pelea
Inundé el garaje, de diamante azul, sin tiburón
Eres una muñeca de Barbie, como Nicki Minaj
No necesitas una llave para conducir, tu coche tiene el cargador
Solo quiero ver el lado, ese que no es molestado (Sí)
Y no quiero que nunca salgas afuera (Afuera)
Prometo que si te engañan, mis colegas aparecerán (Aparecerán)
La estoy follando, y el autobús del tour sigue andando (Andando)
Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado (Salvado, también)
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
(Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós, adiós)
No soy bueno con las despedidas
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
No soy bueno con las despedidas",2019
