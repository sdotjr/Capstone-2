Вижу мир открыто как наркоман
Я тебя вообще не забывал, я
Я с тобой играю, но ты не игра
Тебе одиноко, я спасу тебя
Ничего не жалко, ничё не боюсь
Я юзаю что могу, я тебя люблю
Нет одежды на тебе, в тебе я как в раю
И мы забудем то что было это наяву
Будто бы рокстар, я не работаю, мне похер
На мне маленькие суммы, чувствую себя на тропе
Сердце перестало биться, и там холодно как хоккей
Это цели, а не деньги, биг бой в дороге

These boys all my sons like Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
My city and state never ever seen this

On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros (Zeros)
That's what my bank account balance say (Woo)
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me I know what she 'bout to say

She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again

Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
