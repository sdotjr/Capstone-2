[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang, I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin' Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

A Boogie wit da Hoodie,Still Think About You,"[Intro]
Now I'm saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only 13 when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Chorus]
Got me saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

[Chorus]
Got me saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 3]
But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'
I shoulda known better
You lied I should’ve knew better

[Chorus]
But still I'm saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Outro]
Now I'm saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Even bust a couple juugs with you

They made it feel so real like they really down for you
They clown on you every time they turn around on you
They not loyal, they happy, they lookin' down on you
You really jacking, you don't fuck with me
Now I feel like you never kept it a buck with me
You saying I ain't the daddy, that would be luckily
I'm hoping that ain't my baby, that shit gon' fuck with me
You had me looking like a clown, bitch
That other nigga gon' fuck up running his mouth, bitch
How I fuck him up and drown him in a fountain
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

[Chorus]
But now I'm like, ""What the fuck, nigga?""
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
No kissing and even hugging
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love with it
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches

[Verse 2]
What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I just wanted to fuck with you
Thought you was cool to kick it, probably get lunch with you
I never meant for shit to get so fucking comfortable
Your niggas told you they was down for you
But when you fucked up, nigga, they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou' for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her
I'm a loser, I feel like a fucking loser
Fuck the rumors 'cause I passed her back to ya
Ran through her, then I passed her back to ya
Hah!

[Chorus]
But now I'm feeling like I'm, ahh!
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Love bitches, nah
Now I'm like, ""What the fuck, nigga?""
I don't wanna fall in love with it
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, my nigga, we don't fuck with ya
My nigga, we don't fuck with ya
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga, we don't fuck with ya
My nigga, we don't fuck with ya… why you fuck?
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches

[Part II]

[Verse]
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga, we don't fuck… with ya
So why you fuck with us?
I believed in you, should've told me you had a seed in you
This whole time you was frontin' and I ain't see it in you
Now I'm thinkin' what was you doin' when I ain't sleep with you
Now your toothbrush is my new Jordan cleaner
I know what a ten is, you not Serena
You was supposed to be my dream girl
Two-seater, for me and you in a Bimmer
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Now you showed me not to trust bitches
Fuck bitches, just hit it, never run wit' it
Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch, you did it
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosin'
I don't know how I go through with it, I go through with it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don't fuck… with ya
So why you fuck with us?
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches"

A Boogie wit da Hoodie,No Promises,"[Intro]
Wasn't I good to you?
Cardo got wings

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, ""How to make a milli'"" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, ""Bring the studio to everywhere we go"" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's 'cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you"
A Boogie wit da Hoodie,Look Back at It,"[Chorus]
Look back at it
She ain't never do this before, but she good at it
Said she never made love, but she good at it (She good at it)
She make a nigga feel good when I look at it (Yeah)
I get goosebumps when I look at it (Look at it)

A Boogie wit da Hoodie,Not a Regular Person,"[Intro]
Ness on the beat
I'm not a regular person

[Verse 1]
Done with the perkys
I don't even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don't even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I'm still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain't never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin' and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won't nobody tell you what happened
I'm good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I'm speeding
Nigga you wouldn't believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I'm living everything I was dreaming
I'm killing, I feel like I'm cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can't nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything

[Chorus]
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
My nigga, it's just us now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain't no pounds or ""what's ups"" now
Pretty bitches hit me up now

[Verse 2]
I got on Saint Laurent, come here baby
I just wanted some company baby
I don't want you to feel like I'm playing
Can I fuck you without you complaining?
Got no time for a lunch with you baby
I get bread, what the fuck is you saying?
I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations
I can't stop, I put on for this
Swear to god I put on for this
Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this
I can brag cause I'm confident
I'm the man, ain't no stopping it
I don't got to wait for a shopping list
I want to body a fit then I'm copping it

[Chorus]
I fuck it up, fuck it up now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Ain't no pounds or ""what's ups"" now
My nigga it's just us now
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person"

Young Ugly God, bruh
I made this beautiful beat by myself
I don't care if you goin' to Harvard University
I don't care if you got A-honor roll

If you toes look good
I'm trying to get yo number bitch
I don't care about ya problems
Or what's goin' on at home
It don't matter how you dress
Don't give a fuck about ya clothes
I don't care about ya heart
Nor do I care about ya soul
All I care about is face, titties, booty and ya toes

She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

And don't even act like this message is just for the boys
Girls y'all be looking at ass, too. I be seeing y'all
But you know when you see a big thick booty bitch in the mall
You can't do shit but just look at that booty from a distance

[Verse 1]
Booty from afar, same difference
Young Ugly God spot your booty from a distance
20/20 vision, nigga, I know I ain't trippin'
I just saw a booty from a whole 'nother district
I'm walking in my Sketchers ready for whatever
Booty from a distance, bitch I'm finna bring the pressure
Never disrespect the booty treat it like a treasure
Never disrespect the booty listen to your elders
40 booties from a distance, damn I must be dreamin
I sense another booty from a whole different region
Booty from a distance got me feeling like a demon
Never cuff a bitch, my hoes change like the seasons

My teeny weeny dick came hard like my chorus
Little Dick Clique and I don't wanna be enormous
I open up the booty like a god damn thesaurus
My name is Ugly God but all my hoes is gorgeous
Hoes on my dick cause I just got a abortion
Ugly God get three hoes and have a foursome
I'm ugly but my self esteem higher than your mortgage
Booty from a distance I see booty out in orbit
I could fuck your bitch but your momma more important
Made your bitch come out her shell like a tortoise
Young Ugly God make these other rappers forfeit

Stop smoking Black & Milds, bitch, you nasty
How you smoking Blacks but actin' like you classy?
Why you smoking Blacks? Bitch, you unattractive
Stop smoking Black & Milds, ho, you trashy

[Verse 1]
Stop smoking Black & Milds, with your country ass
You got shit around your mouth, with your crusty ass
You need to go and take a bath, with your musty ass
You need to scrub between your ass, with your dusty ass
Bitch your house got roaches, I ain't going, bitch I can't
Last time we spoke, I smelled your breath, it made me faint
Bitch I hopped up in your Honda Civic, all I smelled was paint
I waited thirty minutes for a jump so we could crank
You can't smoke no Black & Milds and be a fan of me
That ain't your hair I know its weave, bitch stop playing with me
I heard your mama kicked you out, bitch you ain't staying with me
We coolin' now, but bitch in public you ain't friends with me
Bitch your Honda struggling with them dents all in the back
You can hit that head, but I won't let you hit no black
You ain't classy, you ain't shit, but a hood bitch
Why you spent your last dollar on that wood tip?

[Chorus]
Stop smoking Black & Milds, bitch, you nasty
How you smoking Blacks but actin' like you classy?
Why you smoking Blacks? Bitch, you unattractive
Stop smoking Black & Milds, ho, you trashy

Heard the whole hood hit you from the back
I heard the hood ran a train on your track (choo choo)
I heard your daughter's only toy was a jump rope (yup)
That's the black bitch, stop flexin' like that's blunt smoke

And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could

Told you I had hoes, but you must ain't believed me though
Questions, like why I don't answer my phone
Shawty, you tripping, I'm busy, you always wanna fuck up my zone
Texting me paragraphs and textbooks, girl just leave me alone
You ain't my mom or my PO, ain't got to answer you, I'm grown

Do you get it? Do you get it?
This here's something different
What we share is something different
I don't care girl, I'm different
I ain't like these other niggas
I don't care if you was strippin'
Throw it back girl, I'm tippin'
I can't lie girl, I miss it

Yea thats what i'm talkin' 'bout
Naked pictures in my DM's
Wit' a number and a address to they house

Maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20

Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong head
But I remember

Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me

Nothing is the same

That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

But don't you act like
You don't miss the old times
And I don't ever control mine
Don't act like you just dont care
Don't you act like
You don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had
All those good old times we shared
Don't you act (Don't you act)
You don't miss me girl
When we see each other
You don't wanna kiss me girl
I done blown up, I done blown up
And you 'sposed to be with me girl
But people grow, times change like the seasons
And right now I need something to believe in
And for those times that you caught a nigga cheating
For what it's worth it wasn't for no reason

[Bridge]
Cause maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong hitta
I remember

Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me

Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, whoa...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: KYLE]
I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

What's up!
Aw damn it baby you bad
Yeah yeah yeah, heard you got a boyfriend
That's cool girl where is he at?
Oh he fucked up
You lucked up
You done ran into the motherfuckin' man
I'm gonna make you my bae for a day
He should be happy I'm giving you back
'Cause I can make you wifey for a week
We can spend a weekend in Japan
If anyone fuck with my akachan
Tell em' they'll get fucking Jackie Chan-ed
Honestly I'm better as your boy
I'd be kinda shitty as your man
Let's go back to only being friends
Sorry girl I hope you understand

[Chorus: Jane Chile & KYLE]
It's just that
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (Nope)
Love cuts just like a knife (That's right)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (So good, so good)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (Nah, haha)
Love cuts just like a knife (That's right)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (So good, so good)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

I wasn't leading you on girl (No, no)
I just forgot where I was goin'
I got way too attached (Baby)
That wasn't the plan
And I knew a girl just like you once (You once)
We ended up hating each other
'Cause we couldn't let it end (No, no)
That can’t happen again, no

I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end

[Verse 2]
Someone put em up ding-ding-ding
Pulling on my heart strings zing-zing-zing
But I’m trying to let go
But it's hard enough to leave you alone
With the phone goin' ring ring ring
Please let me go
'Cause I don’t want to fall in love
'Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house, she didn’t even let me know
Nigga she ain’t even leave me notes
Part of the reason I’m easily hurt
Part of the reason I’m leaving you first
Pardon that, part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
And I’m sorry it’s you, but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don’t be ashamed you see love is a game and I still want to play
I’m just too scared to lose and I know you are too

[Chorus: Jane Child & KYLE]
I don’t wanna fall in love (No, no)
(But it's, it's good, you know?)
Love cuts just like a knife
(I mean we're young, we don't need to be all tied down)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
(Yo, yo,  honestly fuck this shit, um, yo let's just boogie, alright?)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end"

I got super powers but that's something only I know
What I want is mine if I say it in my mind though
Teach you if I had time, yeah, do I got the time? No
Shit these niggas dream about is not even a milestone
Call up Dr. Seuss, I think they running out of rhymes though
Jugging and finessing, we've heard that a hundred times though
Niggas keep repeating theyself like they in a vine
In a vine, in a vine though
Why they gotta lie, though?
Say them diamonds dancing homie, we know that it's rhinestones
I don't got a 'rari but my whip is really mine though
I don't got no thotties but I know my bitch is fine though
I'm from California, you can tell just by my Vans
My nigga's about it, you can tell just by his stance
Don't throw no subliminals or he'll be throwing hands
My bro-bro play baseball, I hope you know how to catch
I just heard my cue, ooh, they know I'm up next
Curly headed cute cute, she send me the text
Yeah, I been the dude dude since I made a YouTube
Fuck a million views, needed views somewhere floating like I'm Mewtwo

Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it

[Verse 2]
Haircut like the 80's, yeah
Don't need a Mercedes
To maneuver Uber everywhere
Bank account like ...wait
Let's not even take it there
My career don't make it fair
Ain't no elevator to success, I had to take the stairs
How you think I made it here? Climbin', climbin'
How you think you make it here? Grindin', grindin'
I chase after what I want and I don't stop to take a breath
You can't run up on me, yeah
You need to take baby baby baby baby baby steps
Who you think you playin' with?
Nigga I'm a gamer, yeah, you should check my gamer tag
Fire spittin' kid, and who you kiddin'? I will flame your ass
Call of Duty champion, do you know who you aimin' at?
Nigga, you my son, fuck around and I'll rename your ass
Give you to adoption, make your mama come reclaim your ass (Bruh)
Well, I guess that's a little harsh
But everyone can't be a star
Sometimes niggas gotta read they script and play they part
Aw man damn, why is that so hard?
I don't know, I don't know, man
I just want to play Assassin's Creed
Give my baby what she needs
And watch my HBO shows in peace
Peace

[Chorus]
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
Zoning in California on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it"

The New boyz couldn't jerk me
Aye!

I'm just saying they're not me
And if like, I'm fuckin' great
I mean like, what else could they be?
Ya know?
They say that I sound like Drake

Your daughter thinks I'm great

Your motherfuckin' CD package needs to come with a bar of soap
Cause honestly, your verses stink
That shit puts me straight to sleep
Even if I didn't have a nose, I could tell that your verses reek
But its filled with all this shit about
Spots you've never been
And about
Girls you'll never do
And about shit you never did
And all the niggas you killed

KYLE,Focus On You,"[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

[Verse 1]
Well hey girl, it's so insane girl
I'm so in love with all of the things you say girl
But hey girl I know this is like sorta like crazy
But if I could, and you could, then we could, like maybe
Surpass expectations and give a demonstration
Of a committed relation to our loveless generation
And if you do, you can be mine
And if you don't it's totally fine, I'll just accept that I'm a dweeb
Proceed to go home in my room and cry
I'll close the door and I'll ignore the fact you're into other guys
And I'll wash away the pain with a million tears I cry
But if you do (nah), oh baby if you do
I would like to give my entire life to you

[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

[Verse 2]
Hey, wait, hold on, wait
Okay, let me fucking say what I have to fucking say
See I think that you're great, and a gift given from God
Now I believe that God is love and my love is what you are
And you know that it's true, and as pretty as you are
Focusin' on every flaw, every wrinkle, every scar
And everything that you aren't
And the prettiest thing of all is that your nose is not fake
And your boobs are no facade
Baby, you truly are just everything that you are
And that's perfect
Because a silicon soul and a polyester heart
Makes the light inside kinda dark, yeah

[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say"

Ass so fat but that waist so famish
It's all goody as long as I get a woody
You can peck peck with your neck, aw baby
Implantations, that's amazing
Where are you from? Why aren't you famous?
Bet you didn't know that my whip ain't rented
Bet you didn't know that my clothes expensive
Bet you didn't know that my girlfriend Cuban

No habla ingles but she wants my penis

Want me to lay the pipe though, alright though
Told me she just might though, be nice though
Come by the new place and spend the night though
We can go all night though, with no lights though
Want me to lay the pipe though, alright though

[Verse 2]
She wants me to stay close though, Yeah I know so
Me and her are taking photos minus clothes though
Know I got a little dough though, more than most though
We can be on a boat with mimosas
Flow got 'em all wet though, get a coaster
Got girls from posters trying to post up
Told her it's all good though to come over
She wanna learn how to work my controller

KYLE,Remember Me?,"[Verse 1: KYLE]
Yeah, okay well hey yo remember me?
The one you used to rarely meet
Yeah I was just on BET, didn't see? No?
Just something I thought about
Probably happy you know a lot of kids that you fucked off and forgot about
But not this, not what this all about
There is more than that to it
Look I know we've both been through it but
You've been doing anything but what you should be doing like
When I call you on Christmas and you come with excuses
And tell me how you're sorry Kyle but this year I'm Jewish
But last year you was Hindu, and the year before was Buddhist
To keep from buying me clothes, I bet you'll probably be a nudist huh?
Probably have my moms on Maury, asking them to prove it
So I put my face on albums so you'd have to face the music
And when I think about it, it couldn't have been that hard
I didn't need the money man, I just wanted the card
But you was always busy or like somewhere hella far
And ever since I made it, it seems like you never are
That's weird

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory

[Lady]
August 24th 2013 Journal entry 87
The past is just a story we tell ourselves
Do you remember ours?
Tell me the story would you please?

[Verse 2: KYLE]
Yeah, hey look the happy rapper's not so happy now
I remember when I used to laugh out loud
Nowadays I only LOL
Through text cause I don't wanna talk
Don't touch me I don't wanna feel
Rewrote this verse a couple times
First time I kept it way too real
Back before droppin ""Keep It Real""
You really dropped me on my ass
I sent a hundred thousand text's
Don't think you ever sent one back
Let's backtrack back to twenty twelve
Back throwing backpacks to hit the roads
Felt like I died and went to heaven
My life at home was living hell
I told you, you was all I had
It's funny then you couldn't tell
When all your friends was talking shit
It's funny then you couldn't smell
It's funny then you couldn't spell
When I got no answers to those texts
These things get harder to forgive, and even harder to forget
But when I think about it, I'm kinda glad that you did
Don't try to eat with me now
You couldn't starve with me then
A couple months ago fuck
It was hard for us to be friends
Your heart is so much bigger ever since I made it big
Man that's weird

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright
I'll re-jog your memory
I said, you gon' remember me
You say what's your name again?
Finally, don't call but it's alright

I'll re-jog your memory"

Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas

Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em

Pull up with the fye, get 'em, nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it, nigga, ride for the ride of ya life

I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

[Chorus]
Yeah, run Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump nigga, jump
Come here they come run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga—"
JID,NEVER,"[Chorus]
Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never askin', ""Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…""
Again, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never askin', ""Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything…""

[Verse 1]
Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinkin' that they fuckin' with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
""Oh, my God, don't be mean to me""
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch, take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in the way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king, ayy)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

[Chorus]
Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, ""Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…""

[Beat Switch/Interlude]
Uhh, let's go

[Verse 2]
Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

[Outro]
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful"
JID,Workin Out,"[Intro]
Take your heart, don't let me break it in two
I'm sure that I could possibly do nothin' for you
I'm nearly on the edge, I'm 'bout to jump in a few
I'm really not afraid of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, ""Where the fuck you at?""
""On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back""
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit, I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too
Shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry 'cause I'm numb inside (Ugh)
If you wonder why, ask, ""What's the matter?"" (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

[Interlude]
Quiet, don't explain
What is there to gain

[Verse 2]
Shit, shit ain't really working out, huh
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working outta town
Baby, your ass fat, I can see you working out, shit
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well, I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it, if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously, you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead

[Chorus]
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

[Outro: Zack Fox]
C'mon, bruh, come to the booty club one time
Throw some of that Dreamville money
Throw some of that Dreamville money at these hoes, bruh
They got dreams too, nigga
They got shit to do too, nigga
They got dreams too, bruh-bruh
Y'all Dreamville, uh, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, uh-uh
Next time you see that nigga J. Cole, bruh
You tell that nigga the same thing, man
I fuck with y'all niggas, bro
Why that nigga J. Cole, got all this money
Look like he 'bout to borrow somebody charger or something
""C'mon, bruh, let me get your charger, bruh
Let me get my shit to uh, uh, ten percent
And I'll give that shit back to you, bruh bruh""
C'mon, bruh, flex some of that Dreamville money, let me see it"
JID,Off da Zoinkys,"[Intro]
I, I am so grateful
I'm very, very, very grateful
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Uh
Alright, J.I.D and (Christo)

[Verse]
Y'all niggas need to lay off the drugs
Some of y'all need to lay off the dope
My niggas gettin' it straight off the boat
Pure cut, put it straight to your nose
I ain't nosy, but I know what I know
Mr. Know-It-All, ""oh here he go""
I'm the GOAT, I never go with the flow
Throwin' shots, boy, it's blow for a blow
I'm the nigga kick the do' with the do'
I'm the nigga fuck the ho with the ho
I'm the nigga lit the blunt with the blunt
I'ma get it 'cause I want what I want
I'ma say this shit again and again
I'ma go and put this shit to an end
I'm the sickest with the pencil and pen
Hit the blunt and mix the Hen' with the wait
I'ma go ahead and lay off the Xans
I'ma fall back sippin' the lean
I gotta make sure my vision is clear
Oh God, no, it's not what it seems
Six, five, four, one, two, three
.45 tote, you know me
You don't want smoke, so what it's gon' be?
Gotta watch what you say when you lookin' at me
Lookin' at God, lookin' for leaders, lookin' for keys
Look at the pain in your eyes, nigga, look where we been
Look at our wins, look at our sins, and look at our skin
I've been on a frenzy binge tryna get me a Benz
And then your fuzzy ass lens wanna fuck up the ends
Oh God, no, where are my friends?
Lord forgive me, yeah, I need to repent
Mind blurred, need to lay off the drugs
Yeah God, they ain't prayin' enough
Niggas dyin', we ain't sayin' enough
Cops fire, stockpiling rottweiler
Tell my little niggas lay off the stuff
Ronald Reagan, I can't thank him enough
Nah, I'm playin', nigga racist as fuck
Told my nigga if he leave a pack of ports around me, I'ma take em'
And throw em' away
He smoke em' around me, I'ma break em'
And we almost had got into fightin'
I'm talkin' 'bout dead that, finna fade it
But shit, but maybe I did too much
But fuck it, I love my nigga, I'ma save him
And he prolly thinkin' I'm a player-hater
I don't hate a player, I just need all my niggas to wake up
And take a real good look, we a long way from Decatur
Long days still ahead of us, grown dads still scared of us
I'm just workin' my incredible
Stick my dick in the inevitable
So fuck whatever happen, fuckin' cinematic
Sins of the father, I'm a fuckin' addict
Understand addiction, so I'm sympathetic
But I know, I know, I know that I gotta be strong
I ain't tryna be where I don't belong
Little syrup sippin' out of a foam
Little powder, put the pot in the bong
I ain't trippin', I ain't sayin' it's wrong
But, it's some other shit we can be on

[Bridge]
Gangsta Gri-zillz
Oh, now that I may be free, yeah
And he, he...

[Outro]
...if you need it
Yeah
'Cause we the old people, you know
That's way you get blessed
Yeah
That's comes to you, people don't know
Bless, you can see it
God, He come, He come, He come
He come depending what... what you do to people
Uh-huh
That's where bless come from, you know what I mean?
Yeah
You see, you can see that
Look at that, look at how fast President Reagan dead
You don't know him right?
Yeah, I did
Right okay, He was a criminal, you know what I mean?
But look at... at Jimmy Carter
Uh, uh
Jimmy Carter all... more older than Reagan
Uh, uh
Reagan gone already, Carter still here
The good person?
You know what I mean, 'cause he got a open heart
He never do war, when he was President
He never hurt nobody, he help people"
JID,Slick Talk,"[Intro]
Activate, activate, activate, activate
Activate, activate, you know I'm about to activate
Activate, activate, activate, activate
Activate, activate
(Woah, Kenny)

[Verse 1]
Activation, activation
Maturation process, rap game too saturated
Grab your lady, masturbation on her face
An acne patient acting patient, so complacent
Comfortable, a basic bowl of shit
Hold my own, I own my dick
Go shalom, I’m unpredictable
And roll with the clique and fold with big clips
I know I'm feelin' activated when I came in this bitch
Claiming the 6, I don’t care about being famous and shit
I was a bad little never had, nigga get the bag
Give it back to my fam, boy I am who I am
Hope I don't get in a jam in a jam
Had a dream of eating lamb in the Lam'
And the label come off fam with the ram
Like Martin, Gina, Cole, Tommy, and Pam
Start scheming, boy, you die where you-

[Beat Switch]

[Interlude: Jamaican DJ]
Now hear dis! You likkle spit and chew out soundbwoy
You mussi think you can go buy experience a Woolworth!
You mussi think a so King Selassie ah get him crown!
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no way!
You got to work hard for it!

[Verse 2]
Look, okay
This the type of shit that have niggas in beef
Dat slick talk followed by some stick talk then sleep
Pissed off, I done took my fifth loss this week
Big dog, I can scratch that shit off like fleas
I got a lotta shit to say, but I'ma keep my list short
I know alotta your favorites not gon' fuck with this part
When I'm done, please know that I was trying to diss y'all
'Cause if this is a competition, then I’m setting this bar
In my city, who’s with me? I'm in my own lane, jack
Niggas said JID so flame, I propane rap
I’m from East Atlanta like Gucci and Travis Porter
But my story is similar to the hare and the tortoise
Pen so sharp told stories you thought I forged it
Back in the fourth grade, never read Curious Jorge
My nigga Corey kept a little 40 inside his North Face
Left a nigga with no face and beat the court case
Coming home from ball practice, took the street the short way
We from the East, but never gave niggas a reason
To try it or think it's easy, soft pussy niggas eat the sorbet
Or eating your face, or squeeze the heat, then leaving your place
I've been telling you life's a bitch, but it’s a beach in your case
I've been yelling and throwing fits, I'm tired of screaming all day
I've been fighting these fucking demons all day
Man, this shit ain't never been easy, maybe I just need a breather
Hand your boy the blower, let me squeeze it
Blow a little steam, I ain't hating, I'm just heated
Niggas know what I mean, but niggas don't know what I been through
So if I offend you then, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move until the rent due
My niggas' hands itching, finna rob something
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you (Our Father)
Better pray to God

[Verse 3]
Look, okay
Fuck what a nigga say or, look, my mama think I made it
Lift my head to the skies, I cry and begin prayer
Thanks to the maker, got me out of an awful place
My nigga gone for 17 years like a cicada
More than a motivator for me to get off my anus
And kick ass like I'm Danny Mainus
Put the pen pad to the paper, big mad with a painting brush
Splish splash, drawing scenes from my dim lit past
Dimwit, pimp shit, syndicate with the pen grip
Ripping shit, intimate, infinite rhyme kicking, l-l-let's begin
Who's your list? Your top 10? You can say whoever better than
I'm ready now, I was ready then, I was headed down the aisle
Rap game in a wedding gown, she gave me the ring
I said, ""Yes"" and vowed for forever now
On the honeymoon getting naked now
On a money pile doing doggystyle
I'm a father now, and you are my child
Or you aren't my child, I'm on Maury now
And I'm talking loud, the results are found
You are not the, wow, I should kill this bitch like a doggy pound
We divorcing now
I want the cars, ring, clothes, all the house
And you broke my heart, I'm re-organizing
And really trying to be mature about it
But I gotta kill it like a fucking villain
Dream-villain, Spill-villain, rhyme to the ceiling
Would I should I kill a rapper 'cause I coulda
Duh nigga, this a gun and a bullet

[Chorus]
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move till' the rent due
My niggas' hands itching, finna rob something
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you

[Outro]
Not that I need it
This nigga cap as fuck, man
Ain't no cap in my rap
This super cap in your rap, boy
Where y'all niggas from for real?
Where y'all from?
Naw
Ohhh"
JID,D/vision,"[Intro: J. Cole]
Yo, I'm in Atlanta, bruh
Hit me back, lil' nigga

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slept stupid
East side little Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy, you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
""Niggas ain't seein' you, Venus""—shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills—my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my delivery
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time-limit, I'ma take what's mine, nigga
Ha—now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Outro: Johnny Venus]
If you want to act up
If you want to act up
Come, act up"
JID,Hasta Luego,"[Intro]
Hasta luego, I'm finna break

[Verse 1]
All of my, all of my life
I been chasing a check and I never get it
Been around it, seen it, never had it
Mama, daddy, whole family, broke family
I'ma get it, told 'em I'll fuckin' handle it
And murder the game so the service candlelit
Emergency lane and I'm swerving, damaging the whip
But shit, fuck it, I'm fucking vanishing
Had to get out of Atlanta for a little minute
You know that there's madness in the fuckin' city
I thought it was love here
I thought I was good, I'm stuck in the mud here
I'm looking for drugs
I'm looking for big butts with the good hair
Or a ten-piece hot lemon pepper sprinkled
Fries crinkled, that's the lingo
If that's your girlfriend, she acting single
I caught the pass like I'm Ochocinco
I hit the gas down ocho cinco, like 85
It's like 8 or 9 'o clock, my nine cocked
If you on my guap, I won't stop 'til that boy go pop
They won't stop 'til they boy like Pac
They just pop 'til they brain fall out (Damn)
They never know what I be talking about
I only do it 'cause they never really talking about it
Bout it, bout it, turn the music louder, louder
How the fuck did anyone assume the God
The Son, the Son of God, the runnin' from the money
Bleed the blood just like the money, it's not Jumanji
I'm the doom that damned the dungeon
I'm the spoon that fed the hungry
Stand for something, fall for nothing, all or nothing
Y'all niggas balling, huh?
Just to find out that shit is all for nothing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I been going crazy, somebody pray for me
Take a second, take a knee
It'll mean everything, it'll mean everything to me

[Chorus]
I tell 'em to get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em
Hasta luego, we finna make a move
Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em?
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room
I'm finna spray the room (Shit, uh, okay)

[Verse 2]
Ok, everybody rich, everybody skraight, yeah, everybody ballin'
I never had shit, mind over matter, outside, I can't call it
All my niggas finna get a job, or they already got it
Couple trapping, couple catching bodies
Please don't come to East Atlanta, shawty
With your bullshit and your flex cap tryna' juug shit
Nah nigga, you'se a good lick, be a good guy, you a good kid
Never really understood this
But it's probably not for me to understand
I just played the cards I was fucking handed
And dealt with it like a fucking man
You my nigga then you my nigga then
Then we stick together like we Huck and Finn
We gon' get the chicken while we fucking hens
Don't let any nigga come fuck up the plan
If we gotta ride, well then, fuck it, then
If a nigga die, it got out of hand
If I touch the sky then my other guys
Recognize, must avenge
Jeopardize, I publicize, justified
When we busted in, were you terrified?
Was it televised when them rebel guys started busting heads
Over what a nigga said or do to JID?
These the crazy niggas that I grew up with
In the shady city that I grew up in
They ain't doin' shit, but they doin' shit

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hasta luego, I gotta get up away from here
Hoping that somebody pray for me
Telling you it'll mean everything
Everything you know what I mean
There's no working no emergency
I don't wanna be a burden, yeah
I just really hope you love a nigga when he's hurting

[Chorus]
I tell 'em get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em
Hasta luego, we finna make a move
Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room
I'm finna spray the room"
JID,EdEddnEddy,"[Skit]
Nah bruh (Huh?)
What you talking bout, homes?
Ayy, ayy, nigga, Snapchat niggas twisted up real tight
I'm with my motherfucking brothers, nigga (Hahahahah)
They was representing for Trump real tight
But we in this motherfucker real tight
Nigga, ain't left, everything right
Nigga, I'm tight!
Nigga, fuck you talking about?
Bars forever, nigga!

[Intro]
Bars, bars
Me and my two, okay
Me and my two, alright, me and my two, okay

Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy
I'm Zack, you AC, that Jessie and Kelly
I pull up to your hood, just let me know when you ready
I'm rolling up this dub, finna face it, beheaded, mm-mm
Hold on, chill out, please give me a second
I'm drowsy off a Xan, nigga, legs is spaghetti
Cut all of the bullshit, nigga, chop the confetti
You ready? I'm ready, you ready? I'm ready, uh, alright
Never sell weed cause I smoke it too much
I fuck up the pack, I don't fuck with the sack
And I mean the bread come quick
He told me bring him 300
I brought him excuses and like 200 or something
I mean most of y'all niggas love drugs like me
Love me like drugs, bitch, I might be
Yo' love light bulb, turn on lights please
Turn off your cool, I mean, I might freeze
I mean hold on, relax, please give me a chance
I was moving too fast, I ain't hear what you said
We was celebrating life, tryna get to the fetti
But me and my two niggas, we like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, damn

[Outro]
Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy
Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy

JID,Skrawberries,"[Verse 1: J.I.D]
My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long heiress with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat it like a parrot and
Apparently, she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain't looking within
But if you ever in doubt, give this a spin

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Check, look, cool
I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built-up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My homegirl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her ""Feminem""
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
'Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl, you perfect without that makeup or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down"
JID,LAUDER,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Verse 1]
Get my girl angry and pissed and give that pussy a kiss
Pushing the same piece of shit until I get me a Bentley
Same niggas, same goals, same dreams and epiphanies
Me and my niggas are same lines as symmetry, wasn't empathy
Remember we would front yard brawl with big Timothy?
Kicked them doors because we had a lot of energy
My brother was locked up for shooting at the enemy
Caught one nigga then caught fifteen
I ain't meet that nigga 'til I was fifteen
Now I'm kicking 16's with a big screen in attempt to get the big cream
Little guy with a big dream, I need guidance
'Cause if I don't succeed, I probably proceed violence
Sippin' on the brown, no Bobby, I don't fuck with nobody
No team and no posse, you can catch it like Shockey
King of all kings, praise Haile Selassie
Rastafari, I don't need nobody, the God's got me

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Interlude]
You ain't used to the hustle, bro
Yeah, that shit how you live
We on a trade for a trade
I do this for you, I do this for you, you know what I mean?
I took the risk, you took the risk, I ain't disrespect it

[Verse 2]
So part of the reason I be so hard on my people
We never had it easy, never had a pot to pee in
I be on my knees praying till my onomatopoeia's packing a coliseum
Ain't no parking, I gotta see J.I.D
Gotta be there for my family, I gotta, can't try to be
I could be out of my mind, thinking logically
No apologies for speaking how I feel, I silently swore solemnly
That I would be the guy to make my black people proud of me
Roses to the mothers of anybody that doubted me
Yo' chick want dick, bitch dove in the covers
Overseen my areas, surveyed over my brothers
You touch them, you kill me, you can't get close to none of us
They still double-dribble, we going for triple-doubles
Triple up on your investment fuckin' with us
Probably have to rock that vest shit, you fuckin' with us
Wait (Nah bro) Huh? (What you talkin' 'bout, homes?)

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Verse 3]
Okay but fuck that shit, I gotta get it, I gotta get 'em
Tired of picking these locks, you don't respect my existence
I used to sleep in my car, never a park or a bench
But damn a nigga was broke, damnit if I didn't get it
Them niggas was thinking that it was just some rap for the kid
One day they gon' hit my phone, hit the show, scream, clap for the kid
Let's get it poppin', they're pulling pistols on apostle Paul
So pay the piper or meet the sniper, legend of the fall
I knew in diapers you and I was nothing alike at all
I do or die, you do it to die, I'm really making calls
You couldn't kill it and take it out of me, the ideology
This the odyssey, I'm Odysseus, you gotta follow me
Watch how I maneuver, I influence the influencers
The flow is like a fluent influenza going through the motion
So I motivate all of my niggas, they tell me kill 'em with kindness
I'd rather kill 'em and their other significants
Writing lyrics in the city with pretty booties and titties
Don't get the cooties, it ain't like the movies
It kinda is 'cause they're shooting, kind of shit is you moving?
Shit I'm pushing, empower the people life where I grew up
Someone tutored the students, these niggas stupidest, stupider, stupid shit
Sick as a bitch, flick of the wrist, my pen cleanse  my many sins
The irony the iron can't straighten out any wrinkle in existence
Ripple in time triple my eyes realistically sick in the mind
Sick in the head?
Wish I was dead, sick on a med, addicted
My lead sick 'em, give 'em, send 'em to hell, eh

[Outro]
Okay, okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a—
Okay, I told motherfuckers I—

And I got all the drugs in the world that you need (World that you need)
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend (I ain't no fiend)
I got money on my mind, I be stackin' my green (Stacking my green)
Shawty say she like my style, I be dripping with ease (Dripping with ease)
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased (Like to be teased)
Say she got that super soaker, well, girl, just let me see (Just let me see)
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me (Ain't scaring me)
I was destined for this life, it's in my destiny (My destiny)
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most (Doing the most)
How you tell me you my bro, then you went out and told? (Went out and told)
Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes (Folding like clothes)
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul (Ain't trusting a soul)

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the mary jane, no, they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping every day, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a pornstar, a rockstar
Tryna skrrt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl, you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste?
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights, I'm flyin', no, you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need (World that you need)
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend (I ain't no fiend)

Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes (Folding like clothes)
Now purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul (Ain't trusting a soul)

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
Said I ain't never forgotten not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rockstar
That blunt ash on the floor
Well, she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know, toke
Took a drag out that 'Wood, now she goin' for my wood
So we goin' to my hood, yeah, she gonna get it good
Yeah, she know who we are
She want this rockstar life, and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah, she off a bar, and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more"

Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck, want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends

Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu', villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah
I'm tryna cop a Benz, yeah, pull up and drop like ten, yeah
You tryna chase the life (What?) well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out to lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Verse 2]
Not a lot of love
Rollin' in the coupe and she was rollin' off the drugs
Lookin' for the one, girl, you know that I'm the plug
I be booted up with my shooters in the truck
Ayy, and broski keep it and it's tucked
Nigga talkin' 'bout it, but he never runnin' up
Put this shit in motion, so I'm never stayin' stuck
Don't be actin' starstruck every time they show you love

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out to lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

Why you like to lie, shawty, you know you impressed
See you fuckin' with me now 'cause I bossed up, and I flex
All they liked to do was talk, when I knew that I was next
I just come up with these hits and lay low, collect my checks
She fuck with solid niggas (ayy)
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys

Think that bitch from Florida (Florida), you probably can't afford her (no)
Bentley truck might park the coupe (skrr), I'm livin' comfortable
Told money then I'm stuck with you, no, I'm in love with you
Plug pull up in the UFO, no small talk, I'm the CEO
My bitches is bad, they do the most
She way too foreign, straight off the boat
I put her on top, she leakin', she leakin'
Turn to a freak on the weekend, the weekend

I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

[Verse 1]
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
19 with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy, I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, ""Broski, you a star""
I said, ""Brother, hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large""
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage
Now I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage

I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros

Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

[Verse 2]
I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation
I could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated
For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated
Five racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas
Gnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb
Young niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio

I don't want the fame
I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames, I

Be surprised how they act when they know you lit

I haven't been the same since I lost my bro

Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really tell me somethin', ayy

Ayy, girl, never lie to me

Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

Rollin' cookie in L.A., I think I found my bae
She roll my weed, so she gonna be hard to replace
We takin' shots of that Henny, I don't need a chase
Almost forgot where I'm at, can barely feel my face
Rockstar lifestyle, might just die tonight
If I was down and had nobody, would you sacrifice?
They said loose ends break friends, I ain't tryna fight
Fuck bein' sober, girl, come over and enjoy the high
So don't fuck up the vibe, don't ever waste my time
And when I'm feelin' down, will you come stay the night?
And if you far away, then will you book a flight?
My neck flooded with ice, she grip it like a vice
Can't ever play it nice, the world so full of lies
And I'm not bein' them, 'cause I'm just not that guy
You wanna be somebody, so put aside your pride
So open up your eyes, they talkin' from outside

I take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

[Verse 2]
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'
I know they hatin' on me 'cause I really came from nothin'
I just wanna talk to you, can we have discussion?
Why you frontin' on me, shawty, better stop the bluffin'
You better stop the bluffin', I really know you want it
You push that thing up on me, so I'ma jump up on it
I ain't gonna fake it because I know I want it
These niggas so 50, I keep my shit a hundred
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie
And you know we up in the sky
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie
And you know we up in the sky"
Lil Skies,I Know You,"[Intro: Yung Pinch]
Beach boy in this ho, oh, woah

You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Wanna fuck me 'cause them diamonds on my chain
Girl, don't you? Don't you? Yeah, oh

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame

Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Big body, she gon' swerve it, now we way above the surface
Shorty lookin' picture-perfect, say she ready, never nervous
I wanna know like it's urgent, give her good pipe when in person
You want the cars and the purses, baby girl, tell me is it worth it
I'm in a spaceship, get ready for takeoff
Can't fuck with lil' shorty, I know that she basic
She makin' my dick soft, these niggas hatin'
Said I wouldn't make it, I shine with a new floss
I got his girl in a room gettin' naked, she fuck with a real boss
When my gang walk in it's lit (It's lit), legit (Legit)
Give her the D then she dismissed (Dismissed), no kiss (No kiss)
You test me then you getting hit (Hit), lil' bitch (Lil' bitch)
I take my shot and I don't miss (Don't miss), my diamonds piss (Piss)
And girl, that's funny 'cause I know you
You just come around and make a name
Girl, I know you, gon' tell me that you different and you changed
But I know you are everything you say you ain't
You tried to take me down, I left you in the rain
(Ayy, girl I, ayy, girl I)

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me 'cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 2: Yung Pinch]
Look, she want the money and the fame, told her you gotta go
I ain't gon' give your ass a thing, she want a pot of gold
Back when I was young I had a lot of hoes
I'm talkin' back before I got this dough, now I see how they rockin'
I know how you roll now, ain't no need for talkin'
That shit gettin' old now, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these goals down, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these hoes down (Hold up, wait)
Gucci down to the socks (Ho, yeah), that's a beach boy, baby
Pull up to the party, shawty all up on me, now she wanna date me
Said she wanna have my baby
I ain't know that was your lady, oh no
I've been workin' off the clock for this shit, did a lot for this shit
Please don't expect me just to give it up
Shorty wanna rock with the kid
I gave her cock then I dipped, told lil' mama go ahead and live it up

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me 'cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you"
Lil Skies,Fake,"[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't think I love you, my emotions aren't the same
I'd rather be alone than go hangout with some lames
It's funny how they judge you when they see you made a change
I poured another four just to take away the pain
My friends weren't my friends, they was lookin' for some clout
I had what they wanted so they always came around
You told me you would be there but you never held it down
I'm out here bein' loyal, now I'm lookin' like a clown
I popped another Addy, now my heart is speedin' up
And I don't wanna love you, shorty, I just wanna fuck
Got angels on my shoulders, I got demons in my cup
I'm hardly ever out because it's hard for me to trust

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Bridge]
But I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos

[Verse 2]
Roll a blunt and relax, ease your mind (Ease your mind)
I'ma be here for a while, take your time (Take your time)
Lock the doors, spill your heart, never lie (Never lie)
And they talk about me now 'cause I'm that guy (Guy)
They say I needed help but I did this by myself (By myself)
Smokin' all the time, hardly thinkin' 'bout my health
I just been alone, I'm not thinkin' that it helps
They threw me in a fire and expected me to melt
I came out a warrior, I had to make it last
I'm not the type to worry 'bout a problem in the past
And I just keep on movin' knowin' that I made this path
These bitches say they love you but will switch up for some cash
I put myself in college, I was taught that that was right
Well, now I'm 18 and I see that's not my life
I'm under too much pressure, feel like I can't take advice
You only live once, fuck the rules, I'm takin' flight
My niggas in the cage, free 'em out, fuck the law
I swear when they get out, on my life, we gonna ball
You wanna be a great, be yourself, fuck them all
Explain myself too much, now I'm feelin' lockjaw

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Outro]
But I can't do no fake friends (Fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake friends (Fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake hoes (Fake hoes)
No, I can't do no fake bros (Fake bros)
I just need the pesos (Pesos)"
Lil Skies,Signs of Jealousy,"[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, yuh, yuh, yuh
(Menoh)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

[Bridge]
Ayy, why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

[Verse 1]
Getting money, I'm gone on a chase
Fuck a ho, I be stacking my cake
I'm no hero, they gave me the cape
First place when I finish the race
In her room and she giving me face
When I nut, she gon' give me my space
You a lame so you cannot relate
Hittin' licks, had to hide from the jakes
Crack the code, then I open the safe
Get my money, then go out the way
Charged up, I feel like triple-A
Think she loyal, I'm fucking your bae
Let 'em talk, I don't care what they say
Niggas pussy, be riding my wave
Ain't my nigga, then get off the stage
Kick that boy in his shit, Johnny Cage
Pom-pom ass nigga
Ol' Uncle Tom ass niggas
Boy, I don't wanna take a picture
All these niggas talking all on Twitter
Talkin' 'bout pulling up with hitters
You a goofy, just look at your image
I'm in the game like a scrimmage
Stack it up, I can't let it diminish

[Chorus]
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

[Bridge]
Ayy, why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

[Verse 2]
Ayy, and now you're my enemy
You said you was down to ride
But you're not a friend of me
In the game like a referee
I'm just getting what's meant for me
And they love to hate all the time
But these niggas pressed on me
And they tryna copy the swag
But they cannot get it from me
In the kitchen with recipes
Money long like a centipede
I got up and got it on my own
Be faited with destiny
And I'ma go get all the money
And do this for my family"
Cordae,Kung Fu,"[Intro]
Day-Day-Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit but I love cash

[Verse 1]
I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends, ayy
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin juugs, I used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus, to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil' nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened
Got a new bitch from China, she wearing designer
I'm lacing her in the new fashion, ayy

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit but I love cash

[Verse 2]
Ayy, I've been all around the fucking globe
Baby what ya know?
Motherfucker better tuck and roll, got places to go
And niggas missed the last flight, livin' in the fast life
Momma said, ""You never act right, goddamn""
Guess I'm a bad guy, but I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
'Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, and my Benjis blue
Shit is fucked up, when they envy you
'Member niggas got killed over Penny shoes
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty you
It was all a dream, reminiscing over smaller things
Grandma cooking like Paula Deen
It ain't all it seems, grew up with the starving teens
And growing plants, still watering (ahh)

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell Momma I'ma quit but I love cash

Daytrip took it to 10"
Cordae,RNP,"[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Uh, okay, put your fucking hands up, this the fucking anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, ass on her healthy
Young millionaire, what the fuck can you tell me? Smell me?
Nigga, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Like ooh, sound like rich nigga problems
I hit a bad bitch with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness of risky ménages
Like get the head right, she can get what she wanted
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the motherfuckin' dick out my pocket, yeah

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
The opposite
She want me to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 4: YBN Cordae & Anderson .Paak]
I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese
Fuck does that even mean? Nigga, just let the hook sing

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me"
Cordae,Bad Idea,"[Intro: YBN Cordae]
Ooh
Ooh
Yeah, uh
(Bongo ByTheWay)

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
I know myself all too well to be a stranger of pain
Despite it all, we remainin' the same, I'm just changin' the game
Heart pure, never tainted with fame
Straight ahead, I'ma stay in my lane
Never switchin' courses, life's amazin', shit is gorgeous
Lookin' at the bigger picture, portrait, and I smile wide
Performed the song and the crowd cried
How can I lie? I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes
I know the shit you goin' through the last month
You stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt
A nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk
You can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch
Uh, ramen noodles on the regular
Add some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch
Peanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera
And we just flyin' in the nebula

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'
Finally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment
Out South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman
Roundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul
Confused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place
Some of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase
I know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace
I had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste
I promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates
They used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape
Do that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid
Don't ever think it's sweet, that's that crème de la brûlée
Who they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy
My wifey yellin', ""Who they?"" My daughter yellin', ""Hooray""
I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky
I keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye
Like a stye (Uh)

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
So don't you shed a tear
'Cause there'll be better years
I live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear
God cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears
The feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things
Age 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans
You know they a little extra faded around the knees
With the grass stains in 'em
I really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it
Pain, I defeated it, and brought back
Soul survivor, nigga, what you call that?

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it's gon' be alright
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright"
Cordae,Have Mercy,"[Intro]
Kid
Ugh

[Chorus]
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin', huh
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

[Verse 1]
There's no complainin' on this side
My niggas, shit is not tolerated
Cut some niggas off like a operation
And my team way more consolidated
Suite presidential, that's inauguration
'Cause we cookin' crack like Ronald Reagan
Chip on my shoulder, boy, I'm not for waitin'
Divine timin', took a lot of patience
Now it's time for the takeover, all gas and the brake's slower
Took a trip out to Tokyo, now I'm here in Paris for the layover
Fuck old niggas, boy, your day's over
You mad at me because your pace slower
Bitter nigga, you a shade-thrower, I was just sleepin' on a sofa
Now I ride with a paid chauffeur
'Cause I'm way doper, better stay sober
I paint pictures, you a Crayola
I got a bad bitch and she laid over
She really asked could she stay over
I told her that we need to face closure
The smell of money has a great odor
These the things that I prayed over

[Chorus]
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin', huh
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back (Huh, huh)

[Verse 2]
Why cry over spilled milk if you still feel I'm the real deal?
My bitch bad with no ill-will 'cause she'll murk a nigga like Kill Bill
Loose lips sink ships, Cam'ron pink drip, that is my fashion
I'm not really with the high flashin', it's no helpin' with my braggin'
I penetrate it, been the greatest
New house, renovate it
I got the juice, you eliminated
Pussy niggas always instigatin'
Can't fuck me over, boy, I'm too clever
That applies all to whoever
I'm just here to pursue pleasure
Boy, I'm goin' out like Hugh Hefner

[Chorus]
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin', huh
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

Baby Jesus, please save us"
Cordae,Old Niggas,"[Intro]
Damn, Mizzy Mauri got beats

[Verse]
Uh, old niggas and new niggas, now what's the difference?
All in the same boat in a stuck position
So when an old nigga talkin' I don't fuckin' listen
They don't know, every day we make tough decisions
It seems though we is at a generational gap
Which bring conversation and a statement in fact
We can agree, none of us is 'posed to make it in rap
I understand both sides, let me break it in half
Let's take it back: when hip hop originated
And old niggas said it was wack, they couldn't take it
And called it a lil' trend, said it wouldn't last
Now, it's the number one genre as the time passed
Young niggas won't listen and we know it, ha
But old niggas always talk and never show it, uh
You gotta practice what you preach and the classes that you teach
We'll eventually listen, my mind mentally prison, uh
Lately, all my idols, they been failin' me
Catchin' sexual assaults and some felonies
Then, you want me to listen what you tellin' me
And wanna hate when we sing our lil' melodies
And other idols, they be broke, get your funds in order
And Kanye West is a Trump supporter
Then, we got R. Kelly and Bill Cosby
Who still probably got lil' girls in the Hills lobby
And these supposed to be our heroes? Negro, please
Old niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees
Only man I can trust is G-O-D
Not to mention Mos Def and Talib Kweli
Now I get it, y'all think new niggas really suck
And white kids fuckin' love it, lil' silly ducks
But I know it's a lot of bullshit goin' on
I understand, but please, don't complain without a plan
Ironically I wrote this whole song off a xan, nah I'm playin'
I'm just tryna be a fuckin' man
We see you old niggas as a lot of clowns
Not to mention, our father figures was not around
So we all on tours and we hoppin' towns
We just need to sit down and find common ground
And it's soon to come, soon to come
Hip-hop need balance like the moon and sun
It feel good when I wear Christian Louboutins
So I gotta drop music to accrue some funds
And I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest
But feedin' our families, lowering the crime, yet
You want us to be separate and make a contest
Rappin' to stay up out the streets, shouldn't mind that
Stayin' out of prison and we sayin' fuck the system, man
Rappin' is an outlet to go and get our dividends
Rather than out robbin' niggas, sellin' Ritalin
Old niggas bitter, y'all should love it when a nigga win
'Cause we came from the same struggle
Like Diddy and Dame Russell
Was teachin' and gained hustle, got rich, remained subtle
See, I listen, see, I listen
But Lil Dae-Dae water-whippin' in the kitchen
Ready to flip a pack and bring it back, no submission
Gotta just go attack Lil Pump when you're dissin'
I understand both sides of the Ziploc
Y'all old niggas' time is comin', nigga, tick-tock
I'ma still wear all my Gucci flip-flops
And the fuckin' diamond chain with the big rocks
And I'll be the greatest ever, nigga, just watch
Cardi B got rich from Love & Hip Hop, haha"

Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position

[Verse 1]
The game is over, my pain is over, you a lame, a joker
You can't catch me plus my flow is nasty and my name is vulgar
YBN, go and try again, we be the flyest friends
I do my thing, plus I pull some strings just like a violin
Let me tell you 'bout my life and my troubled past
Momma's car got stolen, took the shuttle pass
Re-up from three bucks copped the duffle bag
Please bruh, off these nuts, go and rush some cash
And now we winning again, my brothers spending a band
My niggas posted on the block, damn I be sinning with friends
I'm chasing twenties, Benjamins, and breaking barriers too
My family rich for generations, I might marry a Jew
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position, uh

[Verse 2]
My lifestyle too wild, I know
Everything change with a new high low
Fifty bands, what I cashed in, my show
I got that gas, this that hydro
I'm too great, I don't have rivals
Niggas be telling speed dial 5-0
Cause these niggas be fake, I'm a winner these days
Motherfuckers be sweet, with a hint of cheesecake
Syrup spilling, coughin' penicillin
Heads turning walking in the building
Ledge burnin' often I'm a villain
Was deserted, brought up by some real ones
Had to catch it reckless, was a daily
Momma calling checking on her baby
Took a trip to Texas going crazy
Eating beats for breakfast, I'm elated
I was stressing, blessings on the way
Dropped out, no testing me today
Murder tracks, I bet I beat the case
Redbone, she built like LisaRaye
Stack my chips I bought my Frito Lay
I don't listen what these people say
Fuck a Honda, niggas need a Wraith
Damn the whole team eating great

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster, ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position (ah)"
Cordae,Broke As Fuck,"[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
I was broke as fuck‚ down up on my ass‚ had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store‚ I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada‚ I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot‚ got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
Let me take you niggas back to a much simpler time
Picture yourself inside a vehicle, a ship in my mind
You'll see some childhood memories mixed with the cells of a don
You'll see the doctor smack my ass when I first fell out my mom
A Magic School Bus adventure trip inside my cerebral
Back when I told niggas I'll make it, swear they didn't believe him
Flashback to Brasstracks and we was playin' ""No Problems""
We was crankin' all the classics from the spring to the autumn
And I said motherfuck, need a bad bitch with a tummy tuck
How I make a million from a dollar? It was dummy luck
Need a new Lam', no sedan, fuck a Hummer truck
I'm aiming for the top, I'm steady climbing, fuck a runner-up

[Chorus]
I was broke as fuck, down up on my ass, had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store, I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada, I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot, got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it, ayy

[Interlude]
Uh-huh
(Hey)
Yeah
Woo
Uh, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Mom and dad never had a damn thing, damn shame
Now I'm poppin' champagne on a private jet, fuck an airplane
Order Bossa Nova, eating plantains
Presidential Rollie, fuck a campaign
Impeach, nigga, ten deep, nigga
Remember days we was wearin' J's
And a gold chain, only had three figures
So fortunate, proportionate
Lost Boy, nigga, no coordinates
Remember Christmas? We was giftless
Three foot tree, no ornaments
Pull my dick out, hoes swarmin' it
Flow cold, nigga, no warmin' it
Mama couldn't afford AAU
So we couldn't hoop, nigga, no tournaments
I remember days sippin' lemonade
Ice cream truck gettin' plenty paid
Candy lady had Jolly Ranchers
I don't really have a lot of answers
I'm just searching for the same shit
Same niggas that I came with
Premonitions over reminiscing
Lam' truck how I lane switch (Ah)"
Cordae,My Name Is,"[Intro]
Wooh!
Alright, alright
Now listen, listen loud and clear, you dig?
This is uh, this is history
For real nigga
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Now check me out, listen

[Verse 1]
Why everybody change on me?
While I remain the same, that's why I'm bringing Major Payne
Like mothafuckin' Damon Wayans
And now you chickens is toast, this ain't Raising Cane's
It's clear we wasn't raised the same, rappers lame with fame
I'm known to kill a wack rapper like a bad hobby
I smash hotties and stash bodies, then cop lil' boats
Like that's Yachty, and that's probably
Why I'm so fly that I crash lobbies and after it slap thotties
I'm a rap fanatic who rap fantastic without the platinum status
Why I'm blastin' the maddest 'cause most of these cats is average (uh)
I swear to God that I never lie to avoid a fact
A terrible hair stylist, I'm destroying tracks
I don’t bust guns but my niggas deploy the strap
Then bring out a fucking .45 like Michael Jordan's back
I wanna give these niggas hell if heaven was grant
The best thing from PG since Kevin Durant

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is, yeah
Oh yeah, YBN shit
Don't doubt my name, I said, I tell 'em what my name
Nigga better know the name, yeah, YBN shit
Better know, my name is (yuh)

[Verse 2]
See, a nigga was skippin' class, damn I rather attempt the raps
Said fuck it I'm missing that, when I blow go tick for tack
I'm a boss on my Diddy shit, my flow is too hideous
Dropped out of school, senior year, a true idiot
You see, I wear designer bags, I don't carry minor cash
I'm trying to find the stack, big as Blac Chyna's ass
Oh you wack rhymers, trash climbers, that's kinda sad
In the pathfinder, but my path couldn't find my dad
Now my soul dented, pulled up in a Ghost tinted
In a drive-by, where niggas shooting shit like Cole Bennett
You ho's finished, in this rap shit a cold menace
But I'm flowin' gold liquid, damn I'm so vicious
Uh, my name is Cordae, but don't forget the YBN
I used to get high with friends off grandmama's vicodins
And mix it with a percocet, damn that really worked a sweat
My verse is just perfect, yeah, fuck it go and search the net

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is
Nigga's be the lamest, YBN shit
My name, you nigga's know his name
The nigga's flow is lame, nigga, hah
Man, these niggas whack as fuck
In this music shit, bro, like what the fuck
You niggas suck like shit bro, like
Damn you niggas fucking suck. man"
Cordae,Lost & Found,"[Intro]
Switch up my lifestyle
Yup, yup, uh, huh

[Verse]
Yeah, I was a lost boy, now I'm found
Niggas switched up, they can't come around
See these rap niggas biting my sound
Shout out my bitch for holdin' it down
I had to switch up my lifestyle
If she bad, I'ma go and fuck her lights out
Mama always told me I was a bright child
Naked pictures saved on my iCloud
My goodness, my God, my gracious
Got a bad little bitch, my favorite
And I eat the pussy like it's caviar
Nigga, I ain't talkin' 'bout that playlist
Most necessary, cold February
Flow never buried, shit is everlastin'
Opportunity is never passin'
Was just in school skippin' hella classes
New whip, hit the pedal thrashin'
Grew up where I heard the metal blastin'
I know that greed is the devil's passion
He wears Prada and stiletto fashion
Gucci has become the ghetto fashion
I am just another rebel rappin'
But that studio time led to Louis Vuitton
That I just bought for my mom
Celebration, mix Ciroc and a lime
Rest in peace X, the Pac of his time
Was manifested, can't stop the divine
The nigga speakin' like Barack in his prime
But I'm Bill Clinton with these ill writtens, make the real listen
Seen Monica Lewinsky in the Hills drippin'
Hours later, call me Mike Jones 'cause I'm still tippin'
Call up Scotty with the shotty, 'cause I feel Pippen
I'm a real fresh prince, Uncle Phil, listen
And tell Will Smith how I kill shit
And to please adopt a young nigga
Man, I'm tryna get real rich
Nah I'm playin', shout out to Jaden
So iconic how I go Super Saiyan
New bitch foreign, straight from the Himalayans
On top soon, Lord knows I been prayin'
'Cause I'm on my grind, watch how I kickflip
Money notorious, I'm buyin' big shit
God is so glorious, bless me with riches
I was just broke, now I'm a rich kid
Gas what I smoke, that shit is vicious
Give me that throat, say it's delicious
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician, huh
None of these niggas want smoke with me
So hopefully my flow will breed
Some rappers with actual potency
Spit hot lava, erode the beat, my God

[Outro]
What you think of that, Bren?"
Cordae,Wintertime,"[Verse 1]
Uh, okay, we all got skeletons in our closet from a shady past
Made me brag about my Mercedes, Jag
Going fast, made me crash
My ex keep fuckin' up my car with her crazy ass
Lately, sad
Reminisce the times, please take me back
Aimin' for the top, I'm on target like a Brady pass
Did a show for eighty cash, and threw it in my lady bag
That was fuckin' easy money, sniper, on my KD swag
Thought about quittin', I'm a warrior, can take the jab
Whoever said shit was easy forever lied
I mesmerize, how simple decisions can jeopardize
When Martin Luther cheated and stared in Coretta's eyes
This is lyrical exercise, told my idols to step aside
My mama said I'm buggin', no need for the pesticides
Was just waitin' tables, gave customers extra fries
Maya Angelou with accounts, I just let it rise
And hopefully my words never die

[Chorus]
Wintertime and it's rainin'
But shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Yeah, I can feel the changes (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Try to take a walk up in my shoes
A nigga rappin' like I really got somethin' to prove
'Cause motherfucker, I do
I climb hills, niggas was sleepin', on Nyquil
Paint a picture vivid, dawg, on everything, my life's real
Was just in college, strugglin' to get a nice meal
Made it out the gutter, then that's all because of my skills
All because the glory, nigga, let me tell my story
I am not that nigga with potential, I am not a worry
I was lost like Dory, but I'm finally found
Was addicted to the Xans to calm anxiety down
And I never would admit because society clowns
Any nigga with a problem, they can't quiet me now, nigga

[Chorus]
Wintertime and it's rainin'
But shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Yeah, I can feel the changes

[Outro]
Know where you come from, it's easy to tell where you going
Yeah
Just keep dreaming 'til you find out"

They gotta pay me now just to get up close

Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

[Verse 1]
Niggas lookin' up to me like I made it
I was down, you ain't care, now I'm up and they hate it
I hate waitin', but I had to be patient
Anything I did, I had to be the greatest
Only one Blueface 'cause I'm never changin'
When you make it, everybody start to fake it
You wouldn't understand 'less we could switch places
But I ain't trippin', these Balenciagas ain't got no laces
Hate niggas, my Glock racist
Defender workin' with the same nigga judgin' my cases
Went to jail twice, beat both them felonies
They found large amounts but couldn't prove I was sellin' it
Midtown patriot like I'm Bill Belichick
If you don't want smoke, dumb nigga, then stop inhalin' it
(Stop inhalin' it)
(Broke boy, you don't want no smoke)

[Chorus]
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told

Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

[Verse 2]
Lifestyle expensive
Premium in my Benzes
I tote Glock with extensions
I like a bitch with extensions
Broke boy, don't come up missin' over a mention
I'm just tryna drip in high fashion in a mansion
But I'm never too popular to pop at ya
That .40 go ""bang,"" but the MAC go ""grra-ta-ta""
I leave more shots than ticket sales
Leave more shells than Taco Bell
Tote everywhere, I can make bail
Free the mob out them jail cells
Gotta keep a Glock on me like a lunch pail

[Chorus]
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

[Verse 3]
Yeah, aight, five bands just to get up close
I'm up close, I been livin' fast, lil' baby, suck slow
I was down 'til I got up in the studio
Hop in the booth, then I let the truth be known
Gotta keep the heat just in case it get too cold
Niggas want smoke 'til it's sparkin' out the .40 nose
Now all these bitches want me like I'm Mike Jones
I'm like a man smokin' at a gas station, I'm finna blow
Niggas want beef 'til I heat the shells for tacos
Just 'cause I put my meat in her cheese, I'm still not yours
You was late, I was on time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You wasn't here from the start
You can't get nothin' from Finish Line
I'm selfish, niggas can't have none 'til I finish mine

When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

They gotta pay me now just to get up close"

Sold-out dates, cash every day

This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige

An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young GunWunna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Rolls got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun

Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone

See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home

The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks

Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
They hope that he rotting out in mildew

Copped the new Lam' and put it on land
These fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face
The jet that I'm on, it's sponsored by Wraith

I get cash in my bag while I'm sleep
New blue face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shoppin' spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't not one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze

[Chorus]
Who you think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
I'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love"
Roddy Ricch,The Box,"[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot

(We got London on the track)
(I'm in London, got my beat from London)

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold-hearted nigga, with the blocka-blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

[Verse 1]
When I'm in traffic gotta slide with the beam on me
'Cause I keep 'bout ten racks bussin' out the jeans on me
Niggas be hatin', I'm rich, it's all about the cream, homie
If I ever get caught lackin', they gon' slide
Ever since I got the Rollie, I ain't got the time
Flawless diamonds, niggas can't never block the shine
They know I'm ballin' in the city like DeRozan
Gotta keep my niggas 'round me, I can't do the wrong friends
I was knockin' down walls, now they closin' in
Hopped off the porch, and then I hopped inside the Porsche, ayy
Fuck being the side nigga, I'ma be the main course
Whipped the Rolls like a young nigga made for it

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta

I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

[Verse 2]
Tryna get my bag, I had to go and make it happen
Me and my dogs, we was bussin' out them bandos
Count out them hunnids, then we throw it in the mattress
Wrap it in plastic, and throw it in the attic
I be in the streets, nigga, I stand ten toes
Any nigga in my situation would've been fold
We was trappin' out the basement, made it back tenfold
Gotta stay out the way, that's why I'm always behind the tint for
We was fightin' fed cases, 'member I was 2 and 0
Nigga was fightin' depression, sippin' syrup, I was movin' slow
I was down below, but still, I always kept my head up
Nigga gotta get my bread up, I don't wanna die young
No, no, no

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold-hearted nigga, with the blocka-blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist

It's only Cass’ on it, you dig?
That boy Cassius

[Chorus]
I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I’m dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas

[Verse 1]
Young nigga pullin' up inside the Bentley truck
I just be poppin' shit like hot grease
I remember days sitting at the trap
’Bout to call the plug gotta cop three
Looked up to Pablo Escobar, Money Meech, and Chapo
That’s my top three
Bitch I was serving the sidewalk
Then I copped the drop hopped in the streets
You can't name a young nigga that’s hot as me
All my niggas do murders and robberies
Got about 20 racks in the Robin Jeans
Niggas thinking I won off the lottery
When I hop in the push start with the pound
Niggas know that it ain't no stopping me
Outta town champ like Mayweather
Got a new crib off the boxing ring
Put the new Forgiatos on the Jeep
Run up 30 in a week
I just fuck her I don't keep
.45 Under the pillow
45,000 in the sheets
I want the bag nigga
I can't trust no ho if I know she ain’t married to me
Bitch I done got this shit up out the streets
Red gut period blood on my seats

Black and white, I'm finna have a zebra
She want to ride in the back
Cause I've been having them racks
I ain't showing
She say I ain't got them racks
Thought you knew me better than that
But they ain't knowing
She say my VVS's so annoying
I bought a coupe to spoil her
She want to look out the roof in the morning
YSL got her a new persona
I want to ball like a triple-double nigga
Larry Bird with the racks
Livin' my best life, shorty
You can't never get attached
Went to the plug got a couple P's
Then I Randolph, like Zach
We been sellin' in the projects
Like it's the New Jack City
All my bitches got ass and titties
Got to hop on top the bag and get it
She call me 'cause her main nigga don't beat it up
He something like a pacifist
All a nigga do is sniff her the check
Open her mouth put the dick in her neck
Blue rags bitches crippin' the set
I've been trapping got to get a Patek
Bitch I'm rich I can't be livin' in debt
She won't be my bitch
I can't fuck with the pets
Her best friend end up givin' me sex
In the Tahoe when I jumped out the jet
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup

A nigga came from the bottom, down below
'Member them cold nights, I was sleepin' on the floor
Always dreamed about the Forgiato feet, now they down below
A nigga got so much money on me, I can't count no more

[Verse 1]
'Member I was in the project walls, couldn't even get a loan
Now these niggas got they hands out, if I ain't give it, I'd be wrong
'Member I was in the county jail none of these bitches wasn't pickin' up the phone
Now they bangin' my line, I ain't got time no more
A nigga started from the bottom, now I'm livin'
Early morning, uncle whippin' in the kitchen
Some people said I couldn't do it and then I did it
Look at my bank account, I'm runnin' up the digits
I ain't into all that ""Doin'-that-facade"" shit
I walk it, I talk it, I live it
Come to the bird house, look at the garage, nigga
My Bentley coupe got a couple pigeons
I was down on my ass, had to go a new direction
Bought mom a Gucci purse, gave her 10 racks, told her you ain't gotta stress it
It ain't even an emergency and a nigga 'bout to pull up in a 911
Just to feed my dawgs, I told God it's a blessin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Nigga came from the bottom, I had to make it out
I was trappin' in the box, I had to break out
Hurt my soul when the feds kicked down the vacant house
Black truck on the corner, they had a stakeout
Seen a dopeboy pullin' out a Wraith out
Had to get up out the hood to the lake house
The head chef 'bout to bring my steak out
I was pourin' up the liters, swipin' them Visas
They think a nigga Rondo 'cause I always kept a Nina
Now my jewelry wetter than Aquafina, quick trip to Catalina
White bitch bad as Selena, fuck her, then a nigga gotta leave
I just wanna shine like the Wraith roof stars 'cause a nigga been down so long
Ain't nobody see, bird vision, dawg, got it all on our own
'Member them nights I was trappin', I was trappin' all night long
Now I keep a shooter on the right, just in case a nigga try to do me wrong (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

A nigga came from the bottom, down below (Down below)

Put an Arabic bitch inside of the face
And I got the hood damn near riding every day
Putting money on the opps, no face, no case

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga put the whole damn hood on, huh
Patron of the New, I had put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private planes 'bout to fly with the good old
I fuck with bougie bitches, fuck a hood ho
Hit that bitch from the back and told her ditto
Seen the jakes and a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip-toe
Why you wifin' on a flip ho?
Brought the strap, I'm playin' give 'n' go
Serving junkies out the window
Tried to rob us, got extendo
We ain't playin', no pretendo

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Balenciaga wearin' ass nigga
Hoodied up with a mask, nigga
Shit snatched now you want it back, nigga
I just hope you don't go and rat, nigga
Long johns right under the strap, nigga
That's for you staring ass niggas
Sawed-off head tap, double-tap niggas
That's for you rat niggas
No, I can't do no nine to five
Nah-nah-nah I went to work with the strap, nigga
I came around with five, Roddy came with six
And we got eleven straps with us
Fuck with my ride-or-die
Holes in your body, nigga, like SpongeBob
And backflipping go ta-da-da, ta-da-da
Nigga, I know magic

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga put the whole damn hood on, huh
Patron of the New, I had put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private planes 'bout to fly with the good old
I fuck with bougie bitches, fuck a hood ho
Hit that bitch from the back and told her ditto
Seen the jakes and a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip-toe
Why you wifin' on a flip ho?
Brought the strap, I'm playin' give 'n' go

Tried to rob us, got extendo
We ain't playin', no pretendo"
Roddy Ricch,War Baby,"[Verse 1]
I'm from the bottom of the bottom, check your sources, baby
I'm a war baby, but I can't divorce the pavement
I'm a hood nigga that turned rich so I got Dior's latest
And you know I gotta stick to my roots, I still rock Jordans, baby (Yeah)
It was hell in the projects, I survived the storm
Got brothers in the sky, they die 'fore they born
I know the worst conditions make a champion
Look at my ice, froze like a mannequin
I'm underwater like I'm swimmin' and panickin'
Body bags zipped up like a laminate
The only solution for the opps is to stay inside
How your niggas say they rock, but they don't slide?

[Chorus]
'Cause we was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway (Yeah)
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da (La-da, la-da)
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby (Mhmm)
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby (Mhmm)

[Verse 2]
Like the mob ties in Houston, we got rag ties
I pray the Lord forgive me the day that I got baptized
'Cause I'ma clutch the sticky every time a car passin' by
I don't wanna be Ricky or another victim to homicide
'Cause I know the soul never dies
I make the chrome-chrome fly
Bitch, I'm a wave, Roll Tide
Bullets at your face, Botox
My persona done got her tongue-tied
I was taught that a legend never dies
When it's time, gotta let the lead fly
'Cause I'm a war-war-war baby
Post-traumatic stress, I know the war changed me
Had to bend back but they could never break me
Had to slide

[Chorus]
We was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da (La-da, la-da)
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby (Mhmm, yeah)

Jack Harlow,WHATS POPPIN (Remix),"[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros (Zeros)
That's what my bank account balance say (Woo)
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me I know what she 'bout to say

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
What's poppin'?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin' (Oh, these niggas got me fucked up, nigga)
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh, you know, it's like)
My body got rid of them toxins (Let me go, mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Call up my bitch, tell her, ""Bring me that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Call me DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
I'm real creative and stylish, F&N in my denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday (Nyoom)
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick
I still don't give a fuck what you say
She eat it like a Pac-Man, nigga (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga (Eat it)
I just pulled up in the Batmobile (Nyoom)
The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas (Cap), and they raps ain't real (Cap)
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello like a soda (Soda)
These niggas tattletalers, I'm a soldier
Ayy, somebody tell them niggas that it's over
You know it's Baby, nigga

Brand new whip, just hopped in (Woo, hahaha)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory

In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's

On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion, I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction, I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (Nah)

Jack Harlow,Tyler Herro,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)

[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me (Like me)
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things (Let's do it)
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing (Woo)
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene"" (That's right)
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene (Scene)
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen

Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things

Jack Harlow,SUNDOWN,"[Chorus]
I'm off a tab of that synthetic
Sundown, forty-five minutes 'til this shit set in (Whoop!)
Checking for the kid, I had to chin check him
Big mood, and we teach 'em big lessons over here (Over here!)
2fo coming heavy like we bench pressing
And I'm gon' deliver every time just like a sent message (Yuh!)
In the south and I'm feeling like a pimp
You a simp, I don't feel bad for you, I ain't sympathetic (Hey!)

[Verse]
I just hit the peak, got the kids sweatin'
Out of town chick, tryin' tell her what a Big Red is
I'm a Kentucky boy 'til the death
Go and get it through your head until it's motherfuckin' embedded (Hey!)
She said that I'm full of myself
Go ahead and bust it open, I'ma show you what a big head is (Oh yeah!)
Half of us ain't even got a whip and we tryin' grip grain
First step is go and get breaded
Hit you with the words of wisdom (Ooh!)
New Balance on me while I'm searching for sum'
Trying to touch me out in public 'cause they heard I'm the one
I peel off like my skin when it get burned in the sun (Skrt!)
Self conscious, face blush with ease
Levis put a taper on my dungarees
But I'm still on the block when its a-hundred-three
And humid in the city, but I'm sitting comfortably, yeah (Hey!)

[Chorus]
I'm off a tab of that synthetic
Sundown, forty-five minutes 'til this shit set in (Hey!)
Checking for the kid, I had to chin check him
Big mood, and we teach 'em big lessons over here
2fo coming heavy like we bench pressing
And I'm gon' deliver every time just like a sent message (Hey!)
In the south and I'm feeling like a pimp
You a simp, I don't feel bad  for you, I ain't sympathetic (Woah!)"
Jack Harlow,THRU THE NIGHT,"[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Through the night
She just want the tip, no advice
On the side of the road, what's the risk? Roll the dice
If they catch us, I don't care 'cause we all gon' die (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, we all gon' die
I was worried, to be honest, but it's all goin' right
When I first laid eyes, I was awful enticed
And I might be off something, but I'm all in now
She gotta call in now
I don't think that you should work tomorrow
She said, ""First of all
I'm still goin' in,"" like Rich Homie Quan
But with you and me, God, man, it feels so intense
I already seen that movie but I will go again with you
I got a few I been tending to
But tonight, I forgot all about 'em

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Through the night
I would try to get it tonight
Yeah, the phone on my head like, ""You better do right""
I'm alone in the bed, yeah, I know what you said
Better cope with it
Don't take me for a joke and I won't get a friend that's tryna be more than that
I'm convinced that it's sorta that
When I seen you in the pics, I could tell you was forcin' that
I got time for this
Minus the bullshit, I'm cool now, look at my common sense
And I'm just realizing this
Know my soul isn't trapped
But what's holding me back is the old me, in fact
I'ma get intact, I'ma get it back
Mama, hold me to that
Just, just, just hold me to that
On stack, me and Jack got the city on smack
That's word, huh, that's words
Used to catch 18 all the way to Newburg
It was only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Got a Southern accent, she'll slur a few words
That's virtue, sir, let me share a few words
Hey, let me share a few words
Feeling unappreciated, let me cherish you first, yeah"

Boy you know what the fuck going on
Back up in this bitch, like I never left
Come on, give it to me
Sheesh!

[Verse]
Riding through the city with the windows down
Heard that you was talking 'bout him right there
Boy I swear to god you better switch pronouns
I don't ride waves, I don't switch no sound
I don't hang ten, I'm ten toes down
Had a little song I was gonna put first but boy, god damn, this an intro now
Right back to it never left though
Except for that week I had strep throat
Know this shit boom when we come down south and I had to bring my own Lil Metro
2for's on it, man the kid psychotic
If you looking for the flows or the hits, I got it
When the sun goes down I'ma creep up on it
Like a thief in the night, finna pick your pockets
I ain't really fucking with you hypebeasts (nah)
Really though, I put it on everything (everything)
I don't really be in no shindigs
I ain't been happy since 13
CyHi told me how to deal with the writer's block
Got me thinking maybe I was thinking inside the box
Now we in the house, finna bring it around the block
Know they wanna hang, but we hanging them out to dry (woo, woo, woo)
Guess he never seen this shit coming
She a little older, didn't think she be coming
Only thing I'm trying to do is keep this shit jumping
So I turned this motherfucker to a pole vault
Chicken finger plate for the road, dog
Heard that you was working on a mixtape
Really you can keep it like the coleslaw
Bring the beat back like the overalls
Your boyfriend a tool, that's a Kobalt
When I'm in the booth, make the snow fall
Ain't nobody in my class, check the role call
One name on it, bring the beat to me I'ma come skate on it
Something like Timmy, I'ma Wuntayk on it
Boy, I know this shit's hot, no one takes on it
Pre-Med shorty, turn me on like she hit the reset on me
Told me that we living different lives right now
When I graduated, it was recess for me
All these frat boys won't fuck with the boy
Even when it's really something they could come to enjoy
She don't listen to the lyrics, but she fuck with my voice
I got one-hundred situations that I want to exploit and I'ma do it
That's right, riding through the city on my
Last life, know I had to beat it down
Last night, when she leave the crib she get
Baptized, every time
Funny how it all works out
Right before I did this, I was feeling burnt out
Now the whole city 'bout to get burnt down"

Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Ooh)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, ""Where are we from?""
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean

[Verse 1]
She want me to serenade her, but you know I'm bashful (Ooh)
I got all the whipper-snappers and the lil' rascals (Yeah)
Turnt up off the way we drippin' with Tabasco (Bitch, yeah, yeah)
Old friends inquiring about the cash flow (Okay, okay)
Okay, this kush here in the gaseous state
I can't hit it, if I do I might pass away
These boys fake, please quit with the masquerade, ayy
Shit, I hear what the pastors sayin'
I could prolly use a fresh start, out the window of the TARC
I'm reflectin' on life through Cherokee Park
Thinkin' 'bout life through Cherokee Park (Woo)

[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a paraplegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Gangsta)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason? (Gangsta Grillz)
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, ""Where are we from?""
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's a push start, I ain't gotta put the key in
Whip it real nice like a good human being
24 East, I'm in Chattanooga, TN
Yeah, the barbecue Korean and my shorty muy bien, ayy
We just went from dive bars to The Colosseum
Man he's a try-hard, wouldn't wanna be him
PG, I'm the GM, go 'head copyright it, TM
Go 'head copyright it (Uh)

[Refrain]
Nah we don't wanna say too much (Much)
We ain't take her from you, no, she came to us
Ain't no steak dinner, but we made through brunch (We might)
2for on the beat, you know he came through clutch
Know he came through clutch (Came through)

[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a paraplegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Ooh)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)

Jack Harlow,I WANNA SEE SOME ASS,"[Intro]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna—
Jetson made another one, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, ""I don't wanna move too fast""
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

[Verse 1]
She said, ""Jack, where you been at?""
On the road, but I just got back
And I'm still flyer than a bitch
And ya boyfriend, well he just not that
And I, I don't know how to behave
I'ma tell her be safe
I don't need the pussy, I'ma tell her be safe
I got God with me and he's telling me things

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, ""I don't wanna move too fast""
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm just tryna' see something
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know where we from
I got some money out the ATM, but I'm gonna keep some
Strip club, pre-cum off of the liquor, fell in love with a stripper
Now I'm asking her where she from
As if we gon' be something
I wanna be something
Take my number down, you can hit me if you need some'
Said she got three sons
Do you want four? 'Cause I need one
Do you got whores? 'Cause I'll be one
Going all night like the reruns

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, ""I don't wanna move too fast""
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast"
Jack Harlow,Got Me Thinking,"[Verse 1]
I don't think we can be friends
I don't think that I can even pretend
We used to be such a hit
Now it just feels like a swing and a miss
You used to think I'm the shit
Sometimes I wish you could meet me again
I know you always believed in the kid
And my music and that I'd succeed and go big
And subsequently I'll be bringing you with
We would get married, and we would be rich
Everything changed, I wasn't the same
Now you think that you believed in a myth
I cannot tell you the reason for this
Summer is coming I'm facing temptations
Maybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick
Remember we spent all of those nights in my basement

[Bridge 1]
I know that I'm really all that you want
Wish you could say ""this is all that I need""
I know you see right through all of my fronts
I don't know who I've been trying to be
I do not think that's a problem with us
I just think that is a problem with me, me, me
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no
No no, no no
No no
No no, no no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
Cause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Telling myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets cause I'm scared that I do

[Chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
Ohhhhhhhh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and now we just stuck in the grayest of areas
Thinking back to when I'd say I would marry you
Thinking back to all of them days I would stare at you
Thinking back when you would be drunk at a party
And I was right there I be taking good care of you
I still remember the first time I saw you
And I do not think there was a way of preparing us
For the inevitable, that's how it seems
When you go to college and I chase a dream
Eventually you'll find a man of integrity
Someone that's better you think I could never be, uh
Prolly a guy with some muscles
The type that be smoking and drinking that liquor
Prolly a guy with a beard, prolly a fella who's penis is bigger

[Bridge 2]
I gotta get myself focused again
Sometimes it feels like you're all that I know
I know you think we should only be friends
Cause it might just help us to soften the blow
But I don't think that I can even pretend
I do not think that I'll have that control
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no
No no, no no
No no
No no, no no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
Cause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Telling myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets cause I'm scared that I do

[Chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
Ohhhhhhhh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like"
Polo G,Pop Out,"[Intro]
JD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change

We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change

Bitch it's nighttime, so we bringing out them red dots
Got a long nose nine and this bitch don't blow out snot
Feel like Jordan vs. Utah I'm deadly with that last shot (Bitch)
Back to poking niggas, if I lose everything that I got

Put that barrel on yo head, take yo new chain and yo watch (Pussy)
I been T'd since I got that news my homie dead
Caught yo homie lacking- (Bop, knocked off his dread)
Just a satisfaction we'll come take off a nigga head (Haha)
Hollows like a deadly virus, bodies drop when that shit spread
Explode in his flesh, make a mess, get ripped to shreds
Show no mercy for the enemy nobody getting spared
Man, you niggas bitches why the fuck would I be scared
Thirty shots up in my bomb my momma told me be prepared (Ooh)
Heard the streets been talking, I know what they said

Polo G,Finer Things,"[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Verse 1]
Hard headed, I grew up resilient
It wasn't no heroes, so we looked up to the villains
For generations, bitch, my side of town been drillin'
We been at war ever since them red buildings
It's hard to make peace once blood get to spillin', ayy
Lil Wooski get to shootin' like he filmin'
Yeah, my friends died too, I know that feeling
I'm poppin' ecstasy to help me with the healin'
Leia and lil' baby my younger siblings
I really love 'em, so I treat 'em like my children
Leilani told me stack them bands to the ceiling
I switched my swag up, can't you tell the difference?
I'm finna feed the whole gang with these millions
I'm finna buy my whole hood with these millions
Girl, if I give you my time, that's a privilege
But I can only give my heart to the realest

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights

Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been feelin' like fuck the streets, this shit a scam
These days, if it ain't 'bout money, I don't give a damn
I'm just gon' get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on Instagram
Still with the gang though, one false move, them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say they look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost, it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane
From all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughin'
Sippin' on this codeine got me relaxin'
She say she like how I be swaggin', she love my fashion
VVS my diamonds, my jewelry flashin'
Drip so hard, I'm makin' puddles, bitch, my Gucci splashin'
Fresh to death like my closet in the casket
Fresh to death like my closet in the casket

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

Grindin' for a new life, ayy"
Polo G,21,"[Chorus]
Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

[Verse 1]
Swervin' on the E-way, don't care if I crash in this coupe
Shit I'm thinkin' 'bout too real, might lose my mind in this coupe
Can't relapse off these drugs, man, R.I.P. to Juice
We was tweakin' off them Percs, I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy, like who want smoke? We got plenty guns
Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs
It was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun
I just been ballin' on these niggas like I'm Kendrick Nunn
Every day my birthday, bitch, it's lit, I just turned twenty-one

[Chorus]
Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block

Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

[Verse 2]
Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods
He the type to get excited 'cause he made The Shade Room

[Chorus]
Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top"

I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

[Chorus]
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)

[Verse 2]
I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

[Chorus]
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub"

Hey big brother, it's me, Leia
Remember at the old house I said you was gonna be a big star one day?
I’m so proud of you
Mmh, mmh, mmh, Polo G
Live in the flesh

[Chorus]
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit
Talkin' to my lil' sister, phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin’
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about persevering
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it

[Verse 1]
Phone on DND, I'm out in Cali whippin' through the mountains
Just cruisin', feelin' my song, windows down, speakers pounding, yeah
My engine roaring and that Gucci tiger growling
Expensive taste, my clothes foreign, I be dripping like a fountain
Need new shoes, I started hustling ’cause I didn’t get no allowance
Speeding down the wrong path, found my lane, then I rerouted
Hottest in my city, I had every record label scouting
I got rich and left the hood, still don't leave the crib without it
Swear it ain’t no better feeling than thumbing through these thousands
So much money, can't keep track, I think I might need an accountant
I been runnin' up that check, them blue hundreds just keep piling
Came a long way from depression, all these riches keep me smiling

[Chorus]
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit
Talkin' to my lil’ sister, phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin'
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about perseverance
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it

[Verse 2]
Couldn't leave my brother in them trenches, told him come and stay with me
We gon' live like kings for all them nights ain't have no place to sleep
Niggas watched us starving and never offered us a plate to eat
Took off, now they mad, but I know that they won't wait for me
Last year I took a trip to every place that I couldn't wait to see
Granny, I'm locked up again, sat in that station faithfully
Now I'm the golden child, I used to think my mama hated me
Ain't budging 'bout no problems, what a nigga gon' come take from me?
I heard you a robber, on that concrete, you gon' lay deceased
This .40 waving like a blowdryer, gon' hit his face with heat
With this shit for life, forever gang until I'm 83
Real niggas dyin', it seem like Heaven is the place to be

[Chorus]
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit
Talkin' to my lil' sister, phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin'
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about perseverance
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it"

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, ""I promise you I won't change""

[Verse 1: Polo G]
We make it hot up on your block, we let that heat blow
Catch an opp, we dump the clip, it's time to reload
Put a scope on the AR just like a peephole
Think he a bully, we got choppers for the Deebo
Seven-figure nigga, tryna maximize them three O's
Before the bag, I was fucking all the freak hoes
Ballin' hard, young legend out the Chi, bitch, I'm like D-Rose
""Cap, how you make it out this shit?"" I got the cheat code
Way more than life than just the hood, I'm tryna reach goals
Maxine my heart, since you've been gone, I miss your sweet soul, ayy
Never tell a statement, we won't leak those
Better not go talkin' to them people, better keep closed

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, ""I promise you I won't change""

[Verse 2: Polo G]
We hold a grudge and we want blood, we can't look past the issue
Play with us and you gon' die, nigga, it's kinda simple
Show no mercy, we gon' kill whoever ridin' with you
Catch you on the other side, then we gon' have to get you
Condolences to your family, they gon' have to miss you
Lil Joe on go and he gon' spark, that's if I pass the signal
My right-hand mans, he got his name 'cause he gon' blast the pistol
Earned our stripes, we gon' blow if a nigga play foul, you would think we had a whistle
Lil Capalot, G-O-A-T, yeah, that's that guy's initials
Happiness and depression, I'm stuck inside the middle
I fell in love with dollar signs, won't let my mind forget you
Fuck it off, we spend it all on fast cars and shinin' crystals

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, ""I promise you I won't change"""

[Chorus]
I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that 1300 block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him

[Verse 1]
Addicted to this ecstasy, I like how it feel
It's like I been poppin' X ever since I tried a pill
Shit got me through some hard times, I lost my mind for real
Lot of shit happened way too fast, I ain't have time to heal
Ed was gon' make it on that court but he died in the field
I was still hangin' in the hood before I signed a deal
Posted on Hudson, jakes ridin' past, I had my nine concealed
Hot 'nem do no talking, they just spark shit when it's time to drill
Lil Stank so reckless, he ride fast when he behind the wheel
My shorties hot, keep bending blocks, they gon' slide with the steel
We lost some soldiers in that war so they been tryin' to kill
I be dolo with my ice on, I been tryin' to chill

[Chorus]
I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that 1300 block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him

[Verse 2]
Ain't no playin' both sides over here, please make your mind up and choose
Bitches cheerleadin' and then they sneak dissin', I think they sort of confused
Please stop runnin' your mouth, that's how brothers go missin' and niggas get put on the news
You goin' through it, you losin' it, huh? My shorties eager to tighten your screws
Them blickers go off like alarms, but you ain't wakin' up if you snooze
Niggas be clowns, puttin' on shows for the media, I don't be shit but amused
I won't forget 'bout that lil' shit you said, we gon' get you for frontin' your move
My shootas some hell-raisers, come through clappin' broad, they don't give a fuck 'bout the rules
I played the block, went on them drills by my lonely, I had the four-oh up in school
Fightin' anxiety so I kept spendin' my last on all of the drugs I abuse
Down on my ass, they ain't give a fuck about me, I felt like I ain't have nothin' to lose
Now I'm in my bag, just tryna run up these millis 'cause I ain't got nothin' to prove

[Chorus]
I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that 1300 block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him"

[Chorus]
Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

[Verse 1]
Let's just be friends before we rush into a label
Wanna know if you really fuck with me, girl, what's your angle?
It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
Trauma got me fucked up, so I'm mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you
Most times I'm by myself, I'm still confused from betrayal
From rags to riches, shit still hard, I'm just on phase two

[Chorus]
Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

[Verse 2]
Livin' on his own and he runnin' out of options now
'Cause he felt like he couldn't be hisself at his mama house
Hittin' licks, missin' school, junior year, he thought 'bout droppin' out
Him against the world, 40 on him when he poppin' out
On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise
Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed
He wanna stand over a nigga, leave his face destroyed
He miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid

[Chorus]
Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care"
Polo G,Be Something,"[Chorus: Polo G]
Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'
That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish, ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it, nigga, nobody ever gave me nothin'
Flexin' so hard I might pull a muscle, but I just keep stuntin'
Thirty in the mag, you get body-bagged, I'm just gon' keep dumpin'
Police get behind me, I'ma press the gas, I'm just gon' keep stompin'
I'm just gon' keep stompin'

[Verse 1: Polo G]
Plottin on the come-up, we was schemin'
Now I hit the stage and they screamin'
I was tryna cope through them hard times
For them X pills, I was fiendin'
Got a bad bitch, honey skintone, pretty long hair, she Belizean
Tryna tell you, girl, I can't love you, I'm a cold-hearted lil' demon
Dysfunctional, I can't show affection, might bug out for no reason
Really you don't even gotta be here, I done got so used to people leavin'
You was ridin' for me, then you switched up, now it's fuck you and I mean it
Couple situations left me traumatized, now I say less 'cause I'm speechless
If my brother need it, then I got him, man, the whole gang know how I'm bleedin'
Tryna wake up from them nightmares, devil in my ear while I'm dreamin'
In my past life, did some bad things, I know karma tryna get even
Tryna get away from all the drama, hopped in the Benz, now I'm speedin'

[Chorus: Polo G]
Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'
That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish, ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it, nigga, nobody ever gave me nothin'
Flexin' so hard I might pull a muscle, but I just keep stuntin'
Thirty in the mag, you get body-bagged, I'm just gon' keep dumpin'
Police get behind me, I'ma press the gas, I'm just gon' keep stompin'
I'm just gon' keep stompin'

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Goofy tried stealin' my formula
Look, these niggas corny, these niggas can't come on my corner
I'm the one do what I wanna
I made the guys spin that bitch every day like a carnival
Bought her a Patek Philippe 'cause she wanted one
These niggas nothin' like me, I am one of one
Take the Bentley, four hundred, I pay the bond
You ain't scarin' no one with no gun in this bitch
Everybody go dumb in this bitch
Niggas hoes and they mama a bitch
In the hood like Obama and shit
Presidential tint, no tellin' who in it
Ask around, I bet they tell you we winnin'
Different foreign cars, ain't none of 'em rented
Hundred million cash, I'm comin' to get it
Out in Cali', but my mind in the trenches
I advise the boy to play his position
Run it up and show love to my city
Never leave 'em, I'm bringin' 'em with me
Keep a glizzy, it's goin' in with me, I can't let 'em get me
No time for bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm busy
I'ma go hard 'til I'm forty or fifty
Niggas be talkin', but they never do shit
So if it ain't money, I don't even listen

[Chorus: Polo G]
Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'
That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish, ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it, nigga, nobody ever gave me nothin'
Flexin' so hard I might pull a muscle, but I just keep stuntin'
Thirty in the mag, you get body-bagged, I'm just gon' keep dumpin'
Police get behind me, I'ma press the gas, I'm just gon' keep stompin'
I'm just gon' keep stompin'"
