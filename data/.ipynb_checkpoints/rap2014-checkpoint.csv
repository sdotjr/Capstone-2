1,Laugh Now Cry Later,Drake Featuring Lil Durk,"[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby

Десять на неделе будто рокстар

Попаду в рай, попаду в рай
Попаду в рай, попаду в рай

[Припев]
Десять на неделе будто рокстар
Никого не вспомню, будто стар-стар
Знаю точно попаду в рай-рай
Больше нет таких как я-я
Я внутри тебя словно стрела
Хотела быть лучше - не смогла
Ты никому больше не нужна
Кем тогда ты заменишь меня?

[Куплет]
Вижу мир открыто как наркоман
Я тебя вообще не забывал, я
Я с тобой играю, но ты не игра
Тебе одиноко, я спасу тебя
Ничего не жалко, ничё не боюсь
Я юзаю что могу, я тебя люблю
Нет одежды на тебе, в тебе я как в раю
И мы забудем то что было это наяву
Будто бы рокстар, я не работаю, мне похер
На мне маленькие суммы, чувствую себя на тропе
Сердце перестало биться, и там холодно как хоккей
Это цели, а не деньги, биг бой в дороге

[Хук]
Попаду в рай, сука, попаду в рай
Сука, много грешил, но я попаду в рай
Будто рокстар, сука попаду в рай
Я останусь легендой, как не станет меня

And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday (Nyoom)

Still on the Billboard, the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick

Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga (Eat it)

'Cause they cap-ass niggas (Cap), and they raps ain't real (Cap)
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee

I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again

Да, да, да, да

[Куплет 1: Roddy Ricch]
Я сказал ей, ""Уух-вуу-вуу""
Шоути хочет трахнуть меня внутри купе
Я могу вывезти тебя хоть куда, нахуй реактивный тариф
Отель Versace на мне Versace халат, воу, воу
Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И  я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)
И она любит только деньги, красный свет этим шлюхам
Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу

Как, ""Когда ты полетишь ко мне наедине, могу я приземлиться на этот член?""
Она сказала, ""Трюки для детей"", она не влюбляется в трюки
Она может обращаться с собой самостоятельно, ей просто нужен член
Получил эту большую Birkin сумку стоимостью пять, шесть чисел
Ты может был не в своей лиге, ты можешь купить это, нигга? (Купи это)
Я подхожу к её вершине ухожу на рассвете, я дон
Ты можешь валять дурака, если хочешь, если хочешь
На Бали, большие качели, большое платье
Большая жопа, заставляю её сквиртить и делать большую грязь
До того, как мы закончили, она спросила ""Где мы займёмся этим в следующий раз?""
Дальше, так мокро, что испортили сиденья в самолёте
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Сверху вниз, катаюсь вокруг со стволом
С кем ты?Вуу
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Я сказал, ""Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо""

Ненавидишь это или любишь это (Ах, ах), это мы с тобой (Вуу)
Давай превратим её во что-то
Она сказала, что любит Вуу ниггеров (Вуу, ах)
Тех ниггеров, которые нажмут на курок (Гррт, ох, не, не, не)
Я был в порядке, когда встретил тебя (Встретил тебя, пау)
Затем я трахнул тебя (Вуу)
Затем я оставил тебя (Ах)
Потому что твоя киска чувствовала себя безумной (Безумной, чувствовала безумной)
И у меня не было времени, которое можно потратить (Нет времени, которое можно потратить, давай получим это)

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Shorty a lil' baddie (She a lil' baddie)
Shorty my lil' boo thing (Boo thing)

And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell (Kiss and tell)

[Verse 1: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Every time I fuck, she call me daddy
My lil' mama nasty
I see the pussy through the panties (Whatever you want)
She taste like candy
She a queen, like Nefertiti
Uh oh, my lil' mama sittin' pretty
And we be shoppin' through the city (Oh, oh)
I gave her keys to the Bentley (Woah, woah)
Get off your knees, you don't gotta cry to me
I'm your best friend, baby, you don't gotta lie
I'll get you everything that you want and that you need from Chanel to Celine
It's on you to decide
Valentino, yeah, I put you in the best
Start liftin' up your dress, start kissin' on your neck (Oh no, no)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start massagin' your breasts
I ain't wanna give you a baby just yet, so I backed out and nutted on your breasts
I put you in a Uber (Uber) and sent you to your bed (Oh)
The very next day (Oh), you sent me a text (Oh)
You pulled up to the crib and we did it again (Oh, oh)

You know, I never found love until I looked into your eyes (Until I looked into your eyes)
First time blushin', I ain't even gon' lie (Ain't even gon' lie)
Four rounds in, leavin' bruises on your thighs
You the only bitch could make me spin off on the guys
And the only bitch that make me wanna nut when I'm inside
It's your vibe, leave with me you gettin' high
Girl, ain't bitches fuckin' wit' you even if they tried
She a tsunami, I ain't never felt it dry
Close my eyes while I sleep, hope you be there when I wake
Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great
And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me
And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?
You gon' see the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time
Just because you mine, I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime
Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine
Baby, what's your sign?
I hope you ain't against the slow grind
(Work, work, it's me and you) Me and you
Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do
Through the storm, baby, we can make it through
Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo, yeah
Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin (It's hurtin')
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
Couldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Shorty a lil' baddie
She my lil' boo thing
And shorty got the fatty (Shorty got the fatty)
Shorty be catching mood swings
Every time I fuck without a rubber
I nutted on her covers
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell"

Von, Von (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

[Verse 1]
We in the car, she don't live that far, say she left her purse
And I ain't trippin', you know Von a player, we can go there first
I bust a U, pulled up to her spot, she live by the park
It's gettin' dark, my Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit, this bitch thick as shit
She got two minutes, if she ain't back out, then she gon' need a Lyft
She left her phone, so I picked it up, this ho slow as fuck
Nine missed calls, three of 'em from Mom, the other six say Duck
Now I look up and I see a truck, it's just pullin' up
Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, ""What? What he tryna do?"" So I clutched my move
But he kept walkin', he don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof

[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

[Verse 2]
She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, ""Shit,"" I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""
She started laughin', she say, ""Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd""

[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go

Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you"
20,Tyler Herro,Jack Harlow,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)

[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me (Like me)
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things (Let's do it)
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing (Woo)
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene"" (That's right)
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene (Scene)
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (No, they not NSYNC, no, they not NSYNC)

[Outro]
Word to JT, no, they not NSYNC
Word to JT, no, they not NSYNC
No, they not NSYNC, no-no
No, they not NSYNC, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"

Chama o Hype Williams para o hype, por favor
Uh, eles vão sumir com você antes de você me matar
Abrindo meus cheques, não meus Nikes (Eh)

[Verso 1: Travis Scott & M.I.A.]
Cacti, não é chá gelado (Ah)
Uh, deixei eles confusos tipo Spike Lee (Ah)
Você precisa de mais que o Google pra me achar (Ah)
Eu acabei de chamar a minha mina, pra ela ficar loka (Ah, ooh)
Incrível, no no geral
Eu comecei a gravadora só pra me assinar
Uh, eu e Chase conectados como siameses
Soltamos tanta coisa, me senti numa onda de crimes
Fala comigo de boa, eu vi o rosto dele, vi isso, sim, na camisa branca dele, uh (Vamos)

[Verso 2: Young Thug]
Sim, sim, chama o pessoal da Sprite (Chama eles, peraí)
Voo privado pra França, tentando ver em panorama (Voos privados)
Atirei nas mãos dele, ele estava digitando (Da, da, da)
Ferrari Caterpillar, eu dobro e levanto (Pra cima)
Eu fui para o depoimento, mandei o juiz me passar minha taça (Ayy)
Arrecadei vinte milhões, disse pro diabo manter a sorte
Deixo, deixo a vadia, descanse em paz, Pop, deixo a fumaça (Ayy, slatt)

Faça eles quererem fumar comigo (Sim),é muito o que eu tenho pra gastar
Me fala quando precisar que eu puxe, você vai atirar enquanto eu giro
Viajando como se estivesse feliz no gatilho, peixe salgado, ackee, ackee
Carrinho de golfe, Kawasaki, pesque um peixe, Sushi Maki, viva a vida
Em Londres, saia da cidade (Ah)
Thug e Travis são a tropa, sim, você sabe disso (Parça)
E quando eles nos libertarem, será um filme, um Kodak (Sim)
Atire em mim derramando bem acima da borda como  o Pollack
Eu tava rasgando e correndo, não escorregando ou deslizando, tendências atléticas
Eu tava cozinhando isso, batendo na rocha base, eu forneço o remédio (Vamos lá)
Quando abrimos os portões da Utopia (É quente), é como Zootopia
Você vê as cruzes sobre você (Sim), é assim que você sabe que somos nós
Às quatro da manhã estou te ligando, não para esfregar o ombro
Os Jackboys abrem os limpadores do jeito que eles dobram

Brrt, brrt, baow (Buddah Bless this beat)

[Verse 1]
Imagine niggas lyin' 'bout shootin' a real bitch (Huh?)
Just to save face for rapper niggas you chill with
Imagine me givin' a fuck it was your fuckin' birthday (Fuck you)
You in your feelings, I just thought it was another Thursday
Now imagine me cockblockin' niggas on some dry shit (What?)
I don't want you on the bench, believe you wouldn't've been invited (You wouldn't've been invited)
And if it weren't for me, same week, you would have been indicted (Should've let them lock your ass up)
You offered M's not to talk, I guess that made my friend excited, hmm
Now y'all in cahoots, huh (Okay), you a puss in boots
You shot a 5'10"" bitch with a .22
Talkin' 'bout bones and tendons like them bullets wasn't pellets
A pussy nigga with a pussy gun in his feelings
Okay, he in the backseat and he keep callin' me a bitch (He a bitch)
We all know the shit I could've came back with (Lil'-ass nigga)
He talkin' 'bout his followers, dollars, and goofy shit
I told him, ""You're not poppin', you just on the remix"" (What's poppin'?)
Now here we are, 2020, eight months later
And we still ain't got no fuckin' justice for Breonna Taylor (Breonna Taylor)
Any nigga on that nigga's side is a clout chaser (Fuck y'all)
A bitch who he fuckin' or a ho that he payin', uh

[Interlude]
Imagine me, hahaha
Imagine me entertaining you fuckin' goofy-ass niggas and you fuckin' goofy-ass bitches
Brrt, brrt, blaow (Buddah Bless this beat)

[Verse 2]
Who you takin' shots at, goofy-ass nigga?
Keep your broke ass out a rich bitch business
And that go for you bitches too that's tryna get picked
Talkin' shit, I'll slide on you, thinkin' that you slick
Ooh shit, it's a lotta weak niggas in this bitch
They confused
They hate me, but watch my videos beatin' they dick
Who a snitch? I ain't never went to the police with no names
I thought a bitch that got her chain snatched, caught a loss had something to say, ayy
I be speakin' facts, uh, they can't handle that, uh
They want me to be the bad guy, let me put my mask on
I was chose, I ain't ask to be this motherfuckin' cold
Still the brightest star and not just the ones that's up in this Rolls
Keep it pimpin' always, actions do the talkin'
I know you want the clout, so I ain't sayin' y'all names
Oh, you out here ballin', huh? Who you get that money from?
Ten toes down for whoever get the Patek, huh?
I be so content 'cause I know I'm a real bitch
And anything I say, I'm never scared to repeat it
You'd think I was a killer how these niggas scared as shit
I pull up one deep, but niggas bring they whole clique, ayy
Who you takin' shots at, goofy-ass bitch?
Watchin' me succeed from your knees, suckin' dick
I know you want attention from the niggas that I get
I'm a steak, you a side plate, shrimp, stay in your place
Real bitch, yeah, yeah, I ain't sellin' fairytales
FaceTime my nigga while my other nigga layin' there
Bitch think she sabotagin' somethin', tryna run and tell
Bitch, I got a bond with my niggas and they all aware, yeah
Who you takin' shots at? Shut up with your scary ass
No profile pic, bitch, your mama shouldn't've had
Kick me while I'm down bad, I remember all that
Next nigga send a shot, I'ma sent it right back (Ah)

[Outro]
Brrt, brrt
Brrt, haha
Ah
Should've let them lock your ass up

Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga ""fetch""
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round, spit him back to the street
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da, yeah
I spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets

[Verse 1: Saweetie]
So clean when I pull up to the scene
Big goals, and I put that on me
What you thinkin'? What's good?
Fuck how you feel and I wish a nigga would
Had to hit the Heisman on ya homies
Steppin' in here, bad bitches only
My ex used to act like he owned me
Ain't enough just to treat me like a trophy
I had that, passed that, knew I had to trash that
Bounced on his ass, turned that boy into a flashback
I'm a five-star bitch with a price tag
Gotta find me somebody that could match that
The last one got on my last nerve
Made me go change my passwords
I hit the curve with that swerve
You know I get the last word

[Chorus: Saweetie & Jhené Aiko]
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck

I spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da (Yeah)
Back to the streets

Back to the streets, send you back to your old hood
On hood, baby, this is for your own good
I'm a player-ass bitch and you knew it
Had a good time, now I'm ready for some new dick (Haha)
Pass it to Saweetie, now you hit it
Through with it, there ain't really nothin' else to do with it
Yeah, you know I leveled up
I can't be stuck, I wish you luck, though
Consider yourself blessed
You got to fuck with the baddest
You know that I can't be kept
No, I gotta dip out

Yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We was in the trenches tryna get it out the mud
Lookin' up to killers tryna figure who I was
Sold the Richard Porter, I just wanna feel the love
I feel like a Crip 'cause I can't even trust my blood (Blood)
Loyalty (You know what loyalty is?), I say, ""Spoil me""
You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out about no lawyer fee (No lawyer fee)
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps out tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advicе from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit mе 'bout no show if you ain't come to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought that Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
The Percocet'll take your pain away (Pain away)
One nigga tellin' will take the gang away (The gang away)
Washin' blood with bleach don't wash the stain away (The stain away)
Seen my brother die, he died the strangest way (Stranger way)
Hangin' with the real, won't hang with lames today (Lames today)
Bein' counted out, I had to make a way (Make a way)
Snaked by one of my dawgs, I had to stay away (Stay away)
Millions dollar cash put up for a rainy day (Rainy day)
For a rainy
Durkio, I'm different with it (Different with it)
I praise the trenches like I ain't lose none of my niggas in it (Niggas in it)
I pray my daughter don't go through what I go with different women (Different women)
And I'm talking 'bout all the different niggas (Different niggas)
And I don't get these niggas (Get these niggas)
Why these niggas tryna hang like they ain't lynchin' niggas? (They ain't lynchin' niggas)
The opposition be sayin' my name, tryna get attention with it (Get attention with it)
I know an opp, he was suspect, now he a victim with it (Victim with it)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought the Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy"
